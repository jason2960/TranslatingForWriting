## The Old Man and The Sea   
#### by Ernest Hemingway    
 
 
**Tips**：和余光中的译本比对时，仔细体会原英文中副词的使用，尤其是一个常见的动词短语后又接了个副词，如in，off， against，towards等。

Example：

- the fish was still swimming steadily **out to sea**

- pushed his straw hat hard **down on his head** 
 
- moved **as far into the bow**

- I can always **come in on** the glow from Havana.


## Part 11




"Aqua mala," the man said. "You whore."

"Aqua mala,"老人说，你这个婊子。
 
 
From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny fish that were colored like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small shade the bubble made as it drifted. They were immune to its poison. But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish, he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or poison oak ran give. But these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a whiplash. 

老人轻轻划着桨，顺着桨看向水中，看到一些小鱼，像一条蔓延开的五彩斑斓的细丝带，穿梭在双桨之间，躲在桨的阴影下，当它们浮出水面时，吐出一个一个的泡泡。它们不受浆上分泌出的毒素的影响。老人则不然，当小鱼中的一部分排成一行在那里休息slimy and purple，这时老人正在钓一条鱼，他的胳膊和双手上充满了伤疤，这些是一种会分泌毒素的常春藤或者船桨留下的。而且这些来自 agua mala的毒素来势迅猛，像鞭子一样抽打着老人。

**【困惑&难点】**

But men were not and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was working a fish
这句如何翻译？尤其是rest there slimy and purple
 
 
The iridescent bubbles were beautiful. But they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating them. The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all. The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet.

色彩斑斓，五彩缤纷的泡泡十分美丽。它们也是海上最虚幻的东西，老人很爱看大海龟吃这些泡泡。海龟看到泡泡，从前面慢慢靠近，然后闭上双眼，这样它们就能完全缩进龟壳里，然后吃掉一长条丝带一样的所有这些泡泡。老人喜欢看海龟吃泡泡，他喜欢走在暴风雨后到处是泡泡的海滩上，他粗糙的脚底板踩上一个个的泡泡，发出砰砰砰的声音，他喜欢听这种声音。


He loved green turtles and hawk-bills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he had a friendly contempt for the huge, stupid loggerheads, yellow in their armor-plating, strange in their love-making, and happily eating the Portuguese men-of-war with their eyes shut. 
 
他喜欢绿色的海龟和玳瑁，喜欢它们的优雅，从容，以及它们的重要价值，然而他有点瞧不起那种很大的，愚笨的红海龟，看不惯它们龟壳上的黄色，怪异的交配姿势，以及闭着眼睛欢快地吃着僧帽水母的动作。
 
 
 
He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years. He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton. Most people are about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up and butchered. But the old man thought, I have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs. He ate the white eggs to give himself strength. He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish. 
 
他一点都不觉得海龟神秘，尽管他之前在海龟船上待过很多年。他为所有的海龟难过，即使它们有像小船一样长的腰背，且重达一顿的海龟，多数人对海龟都是狠心的，无情的，因为一只海龟在砍头，宰杀后，它的心脏还能跳数个小时。但老人也想着，我也有这样的一颗心脏，我的双手双脚和海龟的一样。他吃了一些白蛋，好使他有力气。他整个五月份都吃白蛋，在九月吃则是为了变得强壮，十月是为了捕到真正的大鱼。
 
**【困惑&难点】**
Although如何翻译？ He ate them all through May to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish. 中的all through 如何翻译？



He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of the fishermen kept their gear. It was there for all fishermen who wanted it. Most fishermen hated the taste but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes. 

他每天也会喝一杯从小屋里的大桶中取出的鲨鱼肝油，很多渔夫把他们的滑轮放到这个大桶中。那也是所有渔夫都用得着它的地方。大多数渔夫讨厌它的味道，然而比起他们早起几个小时，这还不算太坏，因为他能很好的抵御各种风寒，感冒，而且它对眼睛有好处。



Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again. 

此刻老人抬头看了看，他看到那只鸟又在盘旋了。


---


## Part 12 

 
"He's found fish," he said aloud. No flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of bait fish. But as the old man watched, a small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the water. The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions, churning the water and leaping in long jumps after the bait. They were circling it and driving it. 

他在找鱼，他大声叫道。没有飞鱼跃出水面，也没有四处飞散的饵鱼。但当老人正盯着看时，一只小的金枪鱼飞离水面，转了个身，一头扎进水里。金枪鱼在日光下，银光闪闪，在它坠入水面后，一条又一条的金枪鱼跃出水面，它们从各个方向跳入水面，搅的水面一片混乱。在鱼饵后面长长的一跃。它们绕着它转圈圈，并操纵着它。
 


If they don't travel too fast I will get into them, the old man thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the surface in their panic. 

要是它们不游的这么快，我一定能抓住它们，老人想着，他看到鱼群正在水里奋力游着，溅起一阵白色的水花，飞鸟正俯身扎入饵鱼群中，这些饵鱼由于恐慌正被迫游出水面。



"The bird is a great help," the old man said. Just then the stern line came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna's shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in. 
The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side and into the boat. He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of his neat, fast-moving tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern. 


这些鸟帮大忙了，老人说着。只见他脚下船尾的钓索开始拉紧了，他杂钓索上打了个结，然后丢掉他的双桨，当他牢牢的抓住钓索，并开始往回拉钓索，他能感受到这条小金枪鱼颤抖，挣扎的阻力，的重量。

当他往回拉时，它挣扎的更厉害了，他能看到这条鱼在水中蓝色的背（应该有个专业术语的），金色的侧面（应该有个专业术语的），之后这条鱼不断游向他，绕过船舷到了船仓里 。他（鱼）躺在船尾的日光下，身形紧密，子弹一般的形状，他那大大的，愚钝的眼睛直直的盯着（老人）用它那齐整的，灵活的尾巴，鱼尾猛烈地拍打着船板，似乎在为它受重创的生活，以示反抗。
老人在他头上轻轻一击，并踢了一下，他的身体仍然在船尾的阴影下抖动，颤动。

20180504


"Albacore," he said aloud. "He'll make a beautiful bait. He'll weigh ten pounds." 

海产鱼，他大声叫道。这将会是个很好的鱼饵，重达10磅呢。



He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself. He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they could annoy. 

他忘记了，当他独自一人时，他是何时第一次开始大声和自己说话。
以前他独自一人时会唱歌，有时他也会在晚上唱歌，当他独自在小渔船上或者在海龟船船上掌舵驾驶。他或许是在男孩离开后，独身一人时，开始大声说话的。但他记不起来了，忘了。即使他和男孩一起捕鱼时，他们通常在必要时才说话。他们在晚上夜晚交谈，或者在被暴风雨困住时。大家觉得，在海上（捕鱼时）非必要不说话是种美德，老人也这样觉得，并且敬重这种美德。但此刻，他多次把自己的想法大声说出来，因为他这样做不会打扰到任何一个人。

**【困惑&难点】**
smack means a small boat used for fishing
 
 
 
"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy," he said aloud. "But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to bring them the baseball." 

要是有人听到我大声讲话，他们一定会觉得我疯了，他大声说。可我没疯，我也不在乎。富有的渔人们船上有收音机对他们说话，并给他们带去棒球比赛的消息。


---


## Part 13


Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the northeast. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not know? 

现在没时间想棒球了，他想着。此刻只能想一件事情。即，我生来为了什么。
可能那个鱼群中正有一条大鱼，他想着。我拿起唯一的一根钓有albacore海产鱼鱼饵的枝条，鱼饵正在给鱼群吃掉。然而这些鱼游的太远，也太快了。今天海面上所有的一切都游行的太快了，且都游向了东北方向。那能是一天中捕鱼的最佳时间点吗？或者是我不知道的某种天气的预兆？

**【困惑&难点】**

a big one around that school 如何翻译


He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed white as though they were snowcapped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep. 
 
此刻他看不到海岸的绿带了，只能看到蓝色群山的山顶，以及显现的白色，仿佛盖了一层薄薄的白雪，还有成片的云朵，看起来上面坐落着高耸的雪山。海水一篇漆黑，太阳光在海水中形成了一个个的棱镜。升高的太阳现在使得浮游生物形成的无数的斑点消失了，老人看着蓝色海水中只剩下一道道很深的棱镜，他的钓索依然笔直的深入水中，一英里深的地方。



The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits, were down again. The sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed. 

鲔鱼，又往下沉了沉。渔人们把所有这个种类的鱼都叫鲔鱼，只有在卖出它们以及用它们交换鱼饵时，才会区分它们的确切名字。此刻天气热了起来，老人感到脖子后背热辣辣的，划桨时，他能感觉到汗水正一滴一滴从后背细细淌下。


I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well. 

我可以就这样漂浮着，他想着，睡一觉，把鱼线的绳圈缠绕在我脚指头上来叫醒我。但今天已经是八十五天了，我本该一整天都认真捕鱼的。



Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply. 

正在那时，他正看着他的鱼线，他看到那些布置好的绿色枝条中的一根迅速浸入水面。


"Yes," he said. "Yes," and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger or his right hand. He felt no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna. 

对，他说，对，然后固定好双桨，不过并没有让船颠簸。他迈向鱼线，轻轻用大拇指和食指抓住它，刚好在右手。他既感觉不到鱼线的张力，也感觉不到其重量，他只是从容地拉着鱼线。木棍又蘸了下水面。这是次试探性的拉鱼线，既不强硬也不使蛮劲，他知道恰到好处的力道。水下一百英寻处，一条金枪鱼正在吃沙丁鱼饵，


**【困惑&难点】**

or his right hand？ 如何翻译？


The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension. 

老人用左手抓着鱼线，从容又轻柔，并从木棍上松开。现在鱼线尽情滑过他的手指，咬钩的鱼感觉不到一丝的紧张，拉伸。




This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them. Please eat them. How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them. 

这样放了很远，这一定是这个月钓到的一条大鱼，他想着。咬钩（吃这些沙丁鱼），鱼。咬钩。咬钩吧。它们这么鲜，你却在六百码的漆黑的水下。黑暗中再转一圈，再转个身，回来，咬钩吧。



He felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine's head must have been more difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing. 

他感觉到了轻柔的微弱的拉动，接着是一个猛地拉动，这时一条沙丁鱼的头一定很难从鱼钩上咬下来，然后一动不动了。


"Come on," the old man said aloud. "Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren't they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don't be shy, fish. Eat them." 

继续，加油，老人大声喊着。再转一圈，闻闻这些沙丁鱼。他们不够美味吗？现在尽情享用沙丁鱼吧，还有鲔鱼呢。坚硬，冷峻又美味。别害羞，鱼。吃它们吧。


Make another turn.如何翻译，鱼在水底下到底是如何咬钩的，？

## Part 14




He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same delicate pulling touch again. 

他等着，鱼线悬在他的大拇指和食指间，注视着鱼线，同时也注视着其它的鱼线，因为这条鱼可能向上或向下游动。这时，鱼线再次同样地微弱的拉动了一下。



"He'll take it," the old man said aloud. "God help him to take it." 

他就要上钩了，老人大声说，上帝保佑他上钩吧。



He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing. 

然而他没有上钩。他游走了，老人失望至极。



"He can't have gone," he said. "Christ knows he can't have gone. He's making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it." 

他不能（就这样）游走，他说。基督保佑他不能（就这样）游走。他正在转圈。可能在这之前他就上钩了，他想起了咬钩的事情。


**【困惑&难点】**
"He can't have gone," he said. "Christ knows he can't have gone. He's making a turn. Maybe he has been hooked before and he remembers something of it." 这句翻译时，时态很值得玩味。





Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy. 

这时，他感觉到了鱼线有轻柔的拉动，他开心了起来。




"It was only his turn," he said. "He'll take it." 

刚才他只是转了个圈，他说，他会上钩的。



He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down, down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly through the old man's fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible. 

感觉到鱼线有轻柔的拉动，他很开心，接着他感觉到有东西猛烈的，而且异常重。是这条鱼的重量，他放开线圈一直向下滑去，解开两卷预备的绳圈中的一卷。当绳子坠下时，轻轻滑过老人的手指，他依然能感受到很重的分量，尽管他的拇指和食指几乎感觉不到压力。


**【困惑&难点】**
let the line slip down, down, down如何翻译？


"What a fish," he said. "He has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it."

好一条鱼，他说。他现在一定嘴里咬了一半的鱼饵了，而且正在含着鱼饵游开。




Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down. 

接着他会回来，并吞掉它，他想着。他没有把那些说出来，因为他知道，好事一旦说破了，可能就不会发生了。他明白这条鱼有多大，他想着它正在黑暗中游走，嘴里横着鲔鱼鱼饵。有那么一刻，他感觉它不动了，但依然能感觉到分量。慢慢的重量增加了，他放出了更多的钓索。突然他收紧了拇指与食指的压力，重量增加又急剧下降。


**【困惑&难点】**
with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth.如何翻译？



"He's taken it," he said. "Now I'll let him eat it well."

他上钩了，他说。现在我要让他吃个够。尽情的吃？




He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty fathom coils of line in reserve now, as well as the coil he was using. 

钓索滑过手指，同时他用左手探下身去，迅速把两个备用绳圈的末端解开，并把这两个备用绳圈和即将用到的钓索打了个结，连起来。现在一切就绪。他有三条四十英寻的绳圈备用，以及现在正在用的这条绳圈。



"Eat it a little more," he said. "Eat it well." 

多吃点，他说。尽情地吃




Eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you, he thought. Come up easy and let me put the harpoon into you. All right. Are you ready? Have you been long enough at table? 

吃吧，这样鱼钩的钩尖就会进入你的心脏，杀死你，他想。乖乖浮上来，让我用渔叉叉你吧。好吧，准备好了吗？你吃的时间足够长了吧。



"Now!" he said aloud and struck hard with both hands, gained a yard of line and then struck again and again, swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and the pivoted weight of his body. 

就现在，他大喊一声，双手猛烈行动起来，拉回了一码长的钓索，然后再次拉动钓索，以身体的重量为轴，为中心点，使出手臂所有的力量，在线圈上轮流挥舞着两条手臂。



Nothing happened. The fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an inch. His line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his back until it was so taut that beads of water were jumping from it. Then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull. The boat began to move slowly off toward the northwest. 

没什么用。大鱼在慢慢游走，老人连一英尺都把它拉不起来。大鱼拽的他的钓索强劲有力，他用背部钳住钓索，直到它绷的紧紧的，同时无数水珠从绳上抖落。接着，它在水中开始发出一声绵长的嘶嘶声。他依然拉着它，靠在小船的横梁支撑着自己，斜着后背对抗着鱼的拉动。小船开始向着西北方向缓慢前行。

## Part 15 




The fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water. The other baits were still in the water but there was nothing to be done. 

大鱼平稳地游着，他们漫游在平静的海面上。其它的鱼饵还在水下，不过用不着了。



"I wish I had the boy," the old man said aloud. "I'm being towed by a fish and I'm the towing bit. I could make the line fast. But then he could break it. I must hold him all I can and give him line when he must have it. Thank God he is travelling and not going down." 

我希望男孩在，老人大声说到。我正由一条大鱼拖行着，我还是被拖者。我本可以快速收回钓索。但那样，它可能会挣脱。我必须尽我所能拖住他，当他需要鱼线时，释放给他。谢天谢地，他只是在漫游，不再下潜了。



**【困惑&难点】**
I'm the towing bit.如何翻译，尤其是bit如何翻译？



What I will do if he decides to go down, I don't know. What I'll do if he sounds and dies I don't know. But I'll do something. There are plenty of things I can do. 

要是他决定下潜，我要做什么呢，我不知道。要是他发出哀鸣的叫声，死去，我要做什么呢，我不知道。但我会做些什么。我可以做很多事情。




He held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily to the northwest. 

他用后背拉住钓索，看着它（钓索）倾斜在水中，小船平稳的游向西北方向。



This will kill him, the old man thought. He can't do this forever. But four hours later the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea, towing the skiff, and the old man was still braced solidly with the line across his back. 

这会杀死他，老人想着。他不能一直这样做。但四小时过去了，大鱼仍然平稳的向深（远）海游去，拖着小船，老人也把鱼线绕过后背，坚硬地支撑着。



**【困惑&难点】**

如何翻译：the fish was still swimming steadily out to sea.
Specially for the ** swimming steadily out to sea.**


"It was noon when I hooked him," he said. "And I have never seen him." 

我捉住他时，正是中午，他说。我却从未见过他。




He had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was cutting his forehead. He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the unstepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure. 

在捉住这条鱼之前，他把头上的草帽往下戴了戴，现在它，草帽割伤了他的额头。他也口渴了，跪下来，小心翼翼，以免猛拉到鱼线，尽可能向前弯腰，以便能够单手够着水壶。他打开喝了一点。然后他靠着船头休息。他坐在移去了桅杆和船帆的的船阶上休息，尽量不去想，只忍受着这一切。



Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible. That makes no difference, he thought. I can always come in on the glow from Havana. There are two more hours before the sunsets and maybe he will come up before that. If he doesn't maybe he will come up with the moon. If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise. I have no cramps and I feel strong. It is he that has the hook in his mouth. But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me. 

他向身后望了望，已看不到陆地。不重要了，没多大区别，他想着。我带着哈瓦那的热忱而来。再有两个多小时就日落了，或许日落前他会浮出水面。如果没有，他可能会在午夜浮出来。要是还没有，他会在日出时浮出来。我不抽筋了，感觉又强壮了。正是他钩住了它的嘴。然而什么样的一条鱼会像那样拖拽呢。他一定闭着嘴巴，紧紧咬着鱼线。我多么希望能见到他。哪怕只见一次，我也能知道我一直对抗的是条什么样的鱼。


**【困惑&难点】**
It is he that has the hook in his mouth.  he 指老人？




The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old man's sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of it as almost comfortable. 

据老人看星空识别出的方位，大鱼整晚都没有改变路线，更没变过方向。太阳落下后，天气变冷，老人的汗水风干后，他的后背，双臂，老腿也都冷起来。他已经在白天把用来盖鱼饵箱的麻袋取下，并铺在阳光下晒干了。太阳落下后，他把它系在脖颈上，这样悬着，盖在后背上，他小心地把它放在正横跨（越过）肩膀的鱼线下面。麻袋缓冲了鱼线，他又发现了一种向前斜靠在船头的方式，这样他几乎很舒服了。这种姿势事实上仅仅是稍微不那么不可忍受，但却觉得近乎是舒服了。

## Part 16 



I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as he keeps this up. 

我拿他没办法，他也拿我没办法，他想。不过只要他一直保持这种姿势。

**【困惑&难点】**
How to translate: Not as long as he keeps this up.  


Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his course. The line showed like a photographer streak in the water straight out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the **glow** of Havana was not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish's course held true I must see it for many more hours. I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio. Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing stupid. 

他只站起来这一次，向小船的一侧小便，望着夜空繁星，确认了航向。眼前从肩膀直直延伸出的鱼线像一位摄影师加在水面上的条纹。
他们现在游行的更慢了，来自哈瓦那的亮光也消退了，他知道洋流一定在把他们向东带去。如果我丢掉了哈瓦那的强光，我们一定会去向更东的地方，他想。因为如果大鱼的航向是对的，我一定在数小时前就看出来了。我想知道今天联盟的棒球比赛结果怎么样了，他想。要是有个收音机能收听到这个消息，一定很棒。他这样想着，总想着棒球。想着你在做什么。你除了傻事，还能做什么。
  
**【困惑&难点】**

- Once he stood up   once 在此处如何翻译？是什么意思？一次？

- so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. so that 如何翻译？

- You must do nothing stupid. 如何翻译？



Then he said aloud, "I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this."

然后他大声喊道：我希望男孩在，帮帮我，看看这一切。



No one should be alone in their old age, he thought. But it is unavoidable. I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong. Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you must eat him in the morning. Remember, he said to himself. 

没人在年老时，还应该孤身一人，他想。但这不可避免。我一定要记得在tuna变坏前吃掉它，让自己保持强壮。记住，无论你想吃的多么少，你一定要在早上吃掉它们。记住，他自言自语。



During the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and blowing. He could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female. 

夜晚两只海豚来到船四周，他能听到它们翻滚和喘息的声音。他能辨别出雄海豚的翻滚声和雌海豚的呼气声。




"They are good," he said. "They play and make jokes and love one another. They are our brothers like the flying fish."

他们很好，他说。他们一起玩耍，开玩笑，彼此恩爱。他们像飞鱼一样是我们的兄弟。



Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought. Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely. Perhaps he is too wise to jump. He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush. But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight. He cannot know that it is only one man against him, nor that it is an old man. But what great fish he is and what will he bring in the markets if the flesh is good. He took the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it. I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as desperate as I am? 

接着他开始同情以前钓到的飞鱼。他（老人？飞鱼？）是精彩的，冷漠的，也是知道他多大了的人。他想。我从来没钓到这么大的鱼，也没见过表现的如此冷漠的鱼。可能它（指大鱼）太聪明不愿跳出水面。它可以通过上下跳跃或者横冲直撞摧毁我。但它可能以前被多次捉到过，它知道就应该这样向前游动。他不会知道只有一人在与他对抗，也不知道是位老人。但他是条什么样的大鱼呢？要是鱼肉很鲜，他能带什么到鱼市上什呢？他像一名男性一样咬钩，像男性一样拖拽，他的抗争中丝毫没有恐慌。我想知道，好奇他是否做好了计划，亦或他只是像我一样孤注一掷（铤而走险？）？


wonderful 如何翻译？
当你知道英文原文中的**he**指的就是大鱼（作者为什么不用it呢？）时，译为中文时，**用他还是它**？
