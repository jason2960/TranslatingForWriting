 ## Part 6
 
 "Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid."
 
 你还记得他一般什么时候来平台呢?我想带他去捕鱼，但我很害羞不敢问他。我让你去问他，你也害羞的不敢问。 
 
 "I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives."
 
 我知道，我犯了个大错误。他本来已经和我们一起了。于是我们可以一辈子都在一起捕鱼了。(不会翻译，凭理解，意译)
 
 "I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."
 
 我很想带伟大的DiMaggio一起捕鱼，老人说。据说他父亲也是一名渔夫。他可能和我们一样穷困，窘迫，也能理解我们。 
 
 "The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age."
 
 伟大的Sisler的父亲一点二也不穷，他在我这个年纪时，正和父亲在大联盟打球呢。
 
 "When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening."
 
 我在你这个年纪时，我正站在一艘船的桅杆前，桅杆上挂着方形船帆，正驶向非洲，在夜晚我在海滩上看到了一群狮子。
 
 "I know. You told me."
 
 我知道，我晓得，你告诉过我了。你讲过了。
 
 "Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?"
 
 我们是该聊非洲呢，还是棒球?
 
 "Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J.
 
 棒球吧，我想，男孩说。给我讲讲伟大的 John J. McGraw。约翰·J·麦格劳。他把Jota叫做J。
 
 "He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball.
 
 他老了以后，偶尔会来平台。但他正喝酒时，是粗暴的，不好说话的，让人畏难的。他时刻想着赛马，如同时刻想着棒球一样。他的想法，思想像棒球一样狂野。
"至少他口袋里总是装着列有赛马名字的单子，而且频频在电话上讲那些赛马的名字。

"He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest." "Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager." "Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?" "I think they are equal. "And the best fisherman is you." " No. I know others better."

他是名出色的管理者，男孩说。我父亲觉得他是最棒的。最好的。因为他来这里的次数最多，老人说。如果Durocher也每年持续来这里，你父亲会认为他也是最棒的管理者，最称职的管理者。到底谁是最棒的管理者呢?Luque还是Mike Gonzalez?我觉得他们一样称职，一样棒。最棒的渔夫是你不，我认识其他更出色的渔夫。

"Que va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you." "Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong. "There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say," "I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution." "You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace.

"Aue va男孩说。有许多出色，厉害的，老脸的渔夫，以及其他更棒的渔夫。但你是唯一的。谢谢你。你的话让我很开心。我希望不要有很大的鱼过来，否则它会证明我们两都错了。如果你依然像你说的那么健壮，就不会有这么大的鱼了。我可能没有我想的那么强壮了，老人说。但我懂很多技巧，也有办法。你现在该睡觉了。这样你明天早上才能恢复精力。我会把这些东西都送回平台去。

"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning." "You're my alarm clock." the boy said. "Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?" "I don't know, the boy said. All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard." "I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time." "I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior." "I know." "Sleep well old man.

那晚安。明天早上我会叫醒你。你是我的闹钟。男孩说。年龄是我的闹钟，老人说。为什么老人们醒的这么早?是为了拥有更长的一天吗?不知道，男孩说。我只知道年轻人睡得晚，也不容易睡着?也睡的沉。我记住了，老人说 我会准时叫醒你的。我不想为了他，弄醒自己。似乎我没有价值，不重要。我知道，我懂，我理解老人，睡个好觉把吧

## Part 7

The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed. He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains.

男孩走了出去。他们刚吃饭时桌子上并没有灯光，老人脱掉裤子，摸着黑上了床。他把裤子卷起来做了个枕头，紧挨着放上报纸。他把自己卷进了毯子，睡在另外一些用来盖住床的弹簧的旧报纸上。很快他就睡着了，接着他梦见了非洲，他小的时候，眼前是长长的金黄色的海滩，白色的沙滩，白的刺眼，高高的山谷以及棕色高耸的山峦。

He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning. Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.

他现在每天晚上就住在海岸边上，他在梦里，听到了海浪的咆哮声，看到当地的渔船穿过海浪驶来。他睡着时，闻到了焦油和甲板缝里麻絮的味道，他闻到了非洲大陆清晨吹来的微风。平时他闻到非洲大陆的微风时，就会醒来，穿好衣服去叫醒男孩。但今晚非洲大陆来的很早，他知道在梦里这太早了，他继续做梦，看到了白色的岛屿从海平面上升起，接着他梦到了Canary群岛的各种港口和roadsteads。

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy.simply how to translate?

他没有梦到暴风雪，也没有女人，没有大事件，没有大鱼，没有战斗，没有力量比拼，没有他的妻子。他只是梦到了现在住的地方，梦到了海滩上的狮子。它们像小猫一样正在黄昏下玩耍，他喜欢这些狮子，就像喜欢男孩一样。他从来没梦到过男孩。他不经意间醒了，从开着的门缝里看了看外面的月亮，打开并穿上了裤子。他来到屋子外面小便完，然后走上小路，去叫醒男孩。

He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing. The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.how to translate the dying room? 

他在清早的寒风中瑟瑟发抖。但他知道，这样发抖，自己就能暖和一点，并且不久他就能划船了。男孩住的屋子的门没锁，他推开门，赤着脚，悄悄走了进去。男孩正在第一个房间（the first room 是否有固定翻译？）一个小床上熟睡，外面干瘪的月亮照进来，老人透过光线清晰的看到了男孩。他轻轻抓起男孩的一只脚，摇了摇，知道男孩醒来，转过身来看着他。老人点了点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿过他的裤子，坐在床上，穿上了他们。

The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry." "Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do." They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats. When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder. 

老人走出屋子，男孩紧跟着他。他还没睡醒，老人抱着男孩的肩膀说：对不起，对不住，不好意思？Que'va 男孩说。这正是一个男人应该做的。他们沿着小路向下走去老人的小屋，黑漆漆的，老人赤脚走着，扛着他小船上的桅杆。一到老人住的小屋，男孩便拿起篮子里的鱼线圈，鱼钩，鱼叉，老人扛缠绕着船帆的桅杆。

## Part 8


"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked. "We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some." They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen. "How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep. "Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today." "So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."

你想和咖啡吗?男孩问。我们先把船具放到渔船里，再去喝点咖啡。他们在一个为渔夫服务的早点摊，从一些装浓缩牛奶的罐子里喝了些咖啡。老人你睡的怎么样?男孩问。他现在还在苏醒中，尽管留下他们的睡觉对他而言仍然很难。很好，Manolin，老人回答。我今天信心十足。我也是，男孩说。现在我得去取你的沙丁鱼和我的，还有你的鱼饵。他总是自己拿渔具。他从来不想让其他人拿任何东西。


"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." "I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here." He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.

我们两不一样，老人说。你五岁时，我让你拿东西。我知道，我记得。男孩说。我马上回来，你在喝一杯咖啡。我们在这里赊账。说着他走开了，赤着脚走在珊瑚礁岩石上，向着冰窖走去，那里放着鱼饵。老人慢慢喝完他的咖啡。这是他一整天能吃到的所有东西了，他知道他得喝完。如今很长一段时间以来，吃饭一直困扰着他，他从来不带午饭。他有一瓶水，放在小船的船头。那便是他一整天需要的所有东西。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water. "Good luck old man." "Good luck," the old man said.He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.

这句如何翻译，主要是缺乏渔民捕鱼，划船的背景常识。男孩带着沙丁鱼和两条包在报纸中的鱼饵回来了。他们沿着小路走向小船，祝你好运，老人好运，老人回答。他在黑暗中他开始驶出港口。


There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills. Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.

其他一些穿也中从别的海滩出海，老人听到了船桨来回滑动的声音，即使他此刻看不到他们，现在月亮还在山峦下面。有时有人会在船上讲话。然而多数渔船除了桨划过水面的声音，一片寂静。这些渔船一旦驶离港口，便各自分开，朝着他们觉得能捕到鱼的海域驶去。老人知道自己要去远海，竟自将陆地的气息留在了身后，向充满清早清爽的海洋气息划去。


He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

他看到了海水里漩涡鱼苗发出的磷光，当他划过渔民们常说的great well水域时，因为这里有一个骤深的七百英寻深渊，各种各样的鱼在这里欢聚一堂，洋流的漩涡产生了海洋陡峭的水墙壁。这里会有很多的小虾和可做鱼饵的小鱼，有时在最深处也是乌贼，墨鱼，鱿鱼的猎场，晚上它们会游到近水面来，所有徘徊的鱼都在这里等着捕食它们。

## Part 9

In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.

黑暗中老人能感觉到早晨即将来临，他划船时，听到了飞鱼飞离水面时发出的抖动声，以及它们僵硬的挥动翅膀在黑暗中向上爬升时发出的嘶嘶声。他很喜欢飞鱼，因为它们是他在海上重要的朋友。他为那些鸟感到难过，尤其是那些弱小纤细的黑燕鸥，它们一直在飞翔觅食，几乎从来一无所获，他想着，这些鸟的日子比我们更艰难，除了那些偷食的鸟和那些非常强壮的鸟。


Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea. He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.

大海如此残忍，老天为何让这些鸟儿和这些海燕一样弱小和纤细。她是善良的，非常美丽的。但她也是残忍的，残忍来的如此突然，这些飞翔着的鸟儿，蘸一下水面，觅食捕猎，发出微弱悲伤的声音，和大海比起来，它们显得微不足道。他总把大海想象为他的情人，情人是指当人们喜欢她时，他们就这样用西班牙语称呼她。有时这些爱她的人会说很多她的坏话，但他们总在说，似乎他是为妇女。


Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.

一些年轻的渔夫，他们用浮标作为他们鱼线的标记，他们有摩托艇，是在买鲨鱼肝能赚很多钱时买的，把她(大海?)称作 el mar，这充满了男子气概，气息。他们也把她当做一名对手或某个地方，甚或一个敌人。然而老人总把她想象为充满女性气质的女子，能够给予或克制很大的便利的充满女性气质的女子，哪怕她做了狂野的或邪恶的事情，那也是因为她情不自禁。在月亮的陪衬下，她显得更像一位女人，他想。


He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour. I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them. Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.

他正平稳着划着船，这对他并不费力，因为他能很好的控制速度，海面平静，除了洋流偶尔会产生漩涡。他正借着洋流划船，当他看到一些亮光，他已经比预期的这个时候该到的地方更远了。我以前在一片深水区忙活了一周却一无所获，他想。今天我要去鲣和海产鱼的猎场，或许那里会有大鱼和它们一起。在天真正亮起来之前，他已经弄个把他的鱼饵撒好，它们正飘在洋流上呢。


One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-gar-land on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting. 

一条鱼饵沉下去四十英寻。第二条在七十五英寻处，第三条和第四条则分别沉到了蓝色海水中100和125英寻的地方。每条鱼饵的头部挂在鱼钩的钩颈 鱼钩穿过了整条鱼，鱼饵被紧紧的系住，缝住，整个鱼钩，鱼线和钩尖，都用沙丁鱼盖住了。每条沙丁鱼都用鱼钩穿过双眼，一般的鱼钩都被沙丁鱼裹住了。每条感觉不到甜甜的味道和好的味道的鱼，也不会感觉到鱼钩的任何一部分的存在。

## Part 10


The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. 

男孩给了他两条新鲜的金枪鱼和花科水产鱼，他们挂在两条最深的鱼线上，像两只铅垂一样，另外，他还有一条大的蓝鱼和一条黄色的甲壳鱼，之前用过了，但他们还能用，还是会有厉害的沙丁鱼能闻到它们的气味，被它们吸引。


Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line. Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. 

每条鱼线，圆又厚，宛如一支粗铅笔，系在一条绿色木棍上，这样一旦鱼饵被拉动，这跟木棍就会碰到水面，每条线都有四十英寻的两个线圈长，这样可以很快的接上其它匀出来的线圈，如果需要，而且咬了钩的鱼可以拖着线游三百英寻。此刻老人看着小船一侧的三根木棍是否浸入了水面，（是否碰了下水面），轻轻划着小船使鱼线直直地保持在适当的深度，位置。天大亮了，此刻太阳也升起来了。太阳从海平面露出尖尖的一头，老人可以看到其它的渔船了，这些渔船低于海面，远离海岸，穿过洋流分散开来。


**【困惑&难点】**low on the water and well in toward the shore，spread out across the current.如何翻译？


Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. But, he thought, I keep them with precision.

这时太阳闪闪发亮，刺眼的光照在海面上，完全升了起来。平平的海面把阳光反射进老人的眼睛，深深的刺痛了老人的眼睛，他划着船不看海面。他向水下面看下去，看着鱼线，直直地伸向了黑漆漆的水下。这些鱼线更加笔直了，这点他比其它任何人多做的好，这样做的好处就是，能确保水面下黑暗处不同的高度，都会有鱼饵确切的分布在他期望的位置，等待着游过这些地方的任何一条鱼。其它人会让鱼线随着洋流漂浮着，有时，它们在六十英寻的地方，而他们还以为它们在一百英寻的地方。但，他想着，我就是要让他们保持在精确的位置。


Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore. All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.

难道我再也不会有好运了。但谁知道呢？或许就今天。每天都是新的一天。交到好运固然好。但我宁愿把鱼线布置在精确的位置。这样好运来临时，你就准备好了。又过了两个小时，太阳现在升的更高了。向东望去，阳光也不那么刺眼。目前视野所及，只有三条船，它们看着距海面更低，距离海岸也更远了。我早年的生活中，太阳光一直在伤害我的眼睛，他想。然而眼睛还是很好。晚上我可以直直地看到海面下，而不是一团漆黑。晚上我会看的更清楚。但早上看东西会有点疼。


Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. "He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.

正在那个时候，他看到了一只军舰鸟，拖着长长的黑色尾翼，在他面前的天空中盘旋。它急速下降，倾斜在后掠翼一侧，再次盘旋起来。他一定抓到什么东西了。老人大声叫着。他不只在搜寻。他缓慢又平静的划向那只鸟盘旋的地方。他不着急，保持着他所有的鱼线直直的。但他还是到了洋流稍微湍急的地方，这样他依然可以正确的捕鱼，虽然比他本来要捕鱼的地方会快点。如果他不试着利用那只鸟。


The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface. "Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin." He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow.

这只鸟飞向了更高的天空，再次盘旋起来，只是尾翼不动了。他猛地一下扎进了海面，老人看到飞鱼跳出了水面，拼命在海面上游着。海豚，老人大声叫着，一只大海豚。他把浆放回穿上，从船头的下方拿出一根小型的鱼线。它由一根金属线和一个中号的钩子组成，他把其中一条沙丁鱼放上当鱼饵。然后他带着它来到穿的一侧，迅速绕了个圈，直直地扔进了船尾的海水里。接着他又为另一根鱼线装上了鱼饵，缠绕在线圈上，并把它留在了船头阴影下。


He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water. As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphins were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.

**【困惑&难点】**文本对比时，体会限定性形容词性从句和非限定性形容词从句的翻译。watching the long-winged black bird who was working,

太阳光照进水里产生的奇异光速，而且现在太阳也升的更高了，这些都意味着好天气，还有内陆上方云朵的形状。但此刻几乎看不到鸟儿了，水面上除了一些黄色的斑块，太阳晒白了的海草种子以及一个葡萄牙军人坐在一个紫色的，正式的，变色的胶状袋子上漂浮在一艘船旁边，除此之外，也什么都看不到了。它转了个身，然后又转回来。它像个泡沫一般心甘情愿的飘着，在水面上拖了一条长长的深紫色的细细的涟漪。

他返回去继续划船，并看着长尾黑鸟，此刻，它正在捕食，贴着水面飞行。当他正看到这只鸟又贴了下水面，倾斜着翅膀钻进水面，然后狂乱徒劳地摆动着翅膀，紧跟着飞鱼。老人能够看到水面有轻微的凸起，这是那只大海豚正在追踪逃跑的鱼，升上水面时造成的。海豚正在从睡下切断鱼的航行路线，然后当鱼的速度变慢，游不动时，加速抓住它。


It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast. He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.

这真是个好大的海豚鱼群，他想着。他们四处都是，飞鱼几乎没有生还的机会。那些鸟也没有。这些飞鱼对老人而言太大，而且他们游的也太快了。他看着这些飞鱼一次又一次迸出水面，还有那些鸟儿徒劳的游动。那个鱼群已经离我很远了，他想。他们游的太快，太远了。但说不定我能逮到一条游散的飞鱼呢，亦或我的大鱼就在它们中间。我的大鱼肯定在某个地方。


The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish.

内陆上方的云，现在看着就想层层山峦，海岸变为一条长长的绿线，后面坐落着一座座灰蓝色的山峰。海水现在是深蓝色的，深的近乎发紫。当他看向海水里，他看到深蓝色的水中有很多红色微小的浮游生物，以及此刻太阳光折射产生的奇异的光线。他检查了他的鱼线看它们是否笔直伸到水面下，直到看不到的水面下，他看到这么多浮游生物很开心，这意味着有鱼。


The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man of war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
