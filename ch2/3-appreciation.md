* 整个小说翻译结束后，再整体读几遍，然后和自己写的《李国栋》对比，修改《李国栋》

* 比对时，把生词都添加到欧陆词典中

## Part 6  

"Do you remember when he used to
come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask
him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid."


“你还记得他来平台的时候吗?我想带他去捕鱼，但我很害羞不敢问他。我又让你去问他，你也害羞的不敢问。”


**【比对&反馈】**

余的翻译：“你还记得他以前常来平台吗？我真想带他去钓鱼，可是又不敢请他。后来又叫你去请他，你也不敢。”

简洁，而且顺畅。我自己的读着别扭

When 引导的remember的宾语从句中when的翻译。

 

 "I know. It was a great
mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our
lives."

 

我知道，那是个大错误。他本来已经和我们一起了。于是我们可以一辈子都在一起捕鱼了。(不会翻译，凭理解，意译)

 

**【比对&反馈】**

余翻译：我记得，那是个打错。他也许真会跟我们去。那真够我们乐一辈子了。

 

**【困惑&难点】**

He might have gone with us. Then we
would have that for all of our lives.这两句是属于虚拟语气的翻译吗？

 

"I would like to take the great
DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a
fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."

 

 "The great Sisler's father
was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was
my age."（为什么不直接写and his father
was……）

 

我很想带伟大的DiMaggio一起捕鱼，老人说。据说他父亲也是一名渔夫。他可能（余：恐怕）和我们一样穷困，窘迫，也能理解我们（余：懂得这一套的）。

伟大的Sisler的父亲一点也不穷，他父亲像我这么大时，正在大联盟里打球呢。 

 

"When I was your age I was before
the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on
the beaches in the evening."

 

 

我在你这个年纪时，我正站在一艘船的桅杆前，桅杆上挂着方形船帆，正驶向非洲，在夜晚我在海滩上看到了一群狮子。（夜晚天都黑了，怎么能看到狮子呢，所以应该翻译为黄昏。）

**【比对&反馈】**

余的翻译：我像你这么大时，正在去非洲的一条老式帆船上做水手，到黄昏还看见岸上的狮子。

 

 "I know. You told me."

 

我晓得，你讲过了。

 

"Should we talk about Africa or
about baseball?"

 

我们是聊非洲呢，还是棒球?

 

"Baseball I think," the boy
said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J.

 

我想还是棒球吧，男孩说。给我讲讲伟大的 John J. McGraw。约翰·J·麦格劳。他把Jota叫做J。

 

"He used to come to the Terrace
sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough
and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His
mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at
all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the
telephone."

 

 

他老了以后，偶尔会来平台。但他正喝酒时，他很粗暴，也不好说话，喝起酒来不好应付。他总惦记着赛马，如同总惦记着棒球一样。至少他口袋里总是装着列有赛马名字的单子，而且频频在电话上提到那些马的名字。

 

**【困惑&难点】**

in the older days翻译为早年？

 

 "He was a great
manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest." 

 

"Because he came here the most
times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here
each year your father would think him the greatest manager."

 

 "Who is the greatest manager, really,
Luque or Mike Gonzalez?"

 

 "I think they are equal."

 

And the best fisherman is you."

 

 "No. I know others better."

 

他是名出色的管理者（余：经理人），男孩说。我父亲觉得他是最了不起的。因为他来这里的次数最多，老人说。如果Durocher也年年来这里，你父亲会认为他是最了不起的经理人。

 

到底谁最了不起呢？Luque还是Mike Gonzalez?

 

我觉得他们一样了不起。

 

最棒的渔夫是你。

 

不，我认识其他更出色的渔夫。

 

"Que va," the boy said. "There
are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you."

 

 "Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no
fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong. 

 

"There is no such fish if you are
still strong as you say," 

 

"I may not be as strong as I
think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have
resolution." 

 

"You ought to go to bed now so that
you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the
Terrace."

 

 

Aue va男孩说，是有很多厉害的渔夫，一些渔夫更出色。但你是唯一的。

 

谢谢你。你的话让我很开心。我希望不要有很大的鱼过来，否则它会证明我们两都错了。

 

如果你依然像自己说的那么健壮，就不会有这么大的鱼了。

 

我可能不像自己想的那么强壮了，老人说。但我懂很多技巧，也有办法（余：决心）。

 

现在你该睡觉了。这样你明天早上才能有精神。我会把这些东西都送回平台去。

 

"Good night then. I will wake you
in the morning."

 

 "You're my alarm clock." the boy
said. 

 

"Age is my alarm clock," the
old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer
day?" 

 

"I don't know, the boy said. All I
know is that young boys sleep late and hard."

 "I can remember it," the old man
said. "I'll waken you in time." 

 

"I do not like for him to waken me.
It is as though I were inferior." 

 

"I know." 

 

"Sleep well old man."

 

那晚安。明早我会来叫你。

 

你是我的闹钟。男孩说。

 

年龄（余：老年）是我的闹钟，老人说。为什么老年人醒的这么早?是为了一天过得更长吗?

 

不知道，男孩说。我只知道年轻人睡得晚，也睡的沉。

 

我记住了，老人说 我会准时叫醒你的。

 

 

我不想为了他，弄醒自己（翻译错误）。似乎我没有价值，不重要。

我知道。

余的翻译：我不喜欢让他来叫醒我，那样显得我不中用。

 

老人，睡个好觉吧。

## Part 7

 

 

The boy went out. They had eaten with no
light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the
dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside
them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers
that covered the springs of the bed. 

 

男孩走了出去。他们刚吃饭时桌子上并没有灯光，老人脱掉裤子，摸着黑上了床。他把报纸放在裤子上，卷起来做了个枕头。他把自己卷进了毯子，睡在另外一些旧报纸上，它们盖住了床上漏出来的弹簧。

 

**【比对&反馈】**

他把自己卷进了毯子，睡在另外一些旧报纸上，它们盖住了床上漏出来的弹簧。此处的翻译，我认为翻译为这样更合适，更能凸显出老人居住环境的恶劣，贫苦，老人的平穷。

余的翻译：他用毯子裹住身体，睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。

 

He was asleep in a short time and he
dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white
beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown
mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard
the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the
tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that
the land breeze brought at morning.

 

很快他就睡着了，接着他梦见了他小时候去过的非洲，眼前是长长的金色海滩，白得刺眼的沙滩，高耸的海岬以及褐色的山峦。如今他夜夜重回岸边，在梦里，他听到了海浪的咆哮声，看到当地的渔船穿过海浪驶来。他睡着时，闻到了甲板上焦油和麻绳的味道，他闻到了非洲大陆清晨吹来的微风。（余：还有清晨陆上微风送来的非洲气息。）

 

他闻到了非洲大陆清晨吹来的微风。（余：还有清晨陆上微风送来的非洲气息。）我没有按照语法规则对应的次序来翻译，另外，句子主干为 他闻到了微风，实属搭配不当。

 

Usually when he smelled the land breeze
he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the
land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went
on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then
he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.

 

平时他闻到非洲大陆的微风时，就会醒来，穿好衣服去叫醒男孩。但今晚大陆微风的气息来的很早，他知道在梦里这太早了，便继续做梦，梦见白色的岛屿从海平面上升起，接着他梦到了Canary群岛的各种港口和roadsteads（余：近海的泊站）。

 

 

比对至此20180428

 

He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of
women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of
strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on
the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he
loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the
open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated
outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering
with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon
he would be rowing.

 

simply how to translate?

 

他没有梦到暴风雪，也没有女人，没有大事件，没有大鱼，没有战斗，没有力量比拼，没有他的妻子。他只是梦到了现在住的地方，梦到了海滩上的狮子。它们正在黄昏下像小猫一样玩耍，他喜欢（余：爱）这些狮子，就像喜欢男孩一样。他从来没（余：从未）梦到过男孩。他不经意间醒了，从开着的门缝里看了看外面的月亮，打开（余：抖开）裤子并穿上。他来到屋子外面小便完，然后走上小路（余：走上坡），去叫醒男孩。他在清早的寒风中瑟瑟发抖。但他知道，这样发抖，自己就能暖和一点，而且很快他就能（余：要）划船了。

 

**【比对&反馈】**

余的翻译：他不再梦见狂风暴雨，或者女人，或者大场面，或者具鱼，或者拳赛，或者角力，或者亡妻。

 

No longer 译为不再更合适。因为前面提到过他的妻子死了，所以此处his wife 译为：亡妻。

 

 

The door of the house where the boy
lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet.
The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him
clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one
foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The
old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and,
sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

 

 

男孩住屋的门没锁，他推开门，赤着脚，悄悄走了进去。男孩正在第一个房间一个小床上熟睡，干瘪的月亮照进来，老人透过光线清晰的（余：一眼）看到了（余：他）。他轻轻抓起一只脚，摇了摇（余：不放，自己的翻译属于过度意译），直到男孩醒来，转身看着他。老人点了点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿过他的裤子，坐在床上，穿上了他们。

 

**【比对&反馈】**



 

How to translate the dying room? 

 

阿杰：男孩正在第一个房间一个小床上（状语）熟睡（动词谓语）。

余的翻译：男孩熟睡在第一间房里的小床上。

自己翻译的很多句子都出现类似的毛病，从语法和表达上看都没有问题，英文的表达自然是合适的，然而中文却总是怪怪的，生硬，不够自然。看来翻译的基本功真的是中文，其次才是英文。没有中文的语法，句法，语感积累，翻译出来的英文也不会自然流畅。

 

The old man went out the door and the
boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his
shoulders and said, "I am sorry."

 

 "Que'va," the boy said. "It is
what a man must do." 

 

They walked down the road to the old
man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying
the masts of their boats. 

 

When they reached the old man's shack
the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the
old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.

 

老人走出屋子，男孩紧跟着他。他还没睡醒，老人抱（余：搂）着男孩的肩膀说：“对不起。”

Qué va（余：哪里话） 男孩说，这正是一个男人应该做的。

他们沿路向老人的小屋走去，黑漆漆的，老人赤脚走着，扛着他小船上的桅杆。一到老人住的小屋，男孩便拿起装鱼绳圈的篮子，鱼钩，鱼叉，老人扛起了卷着船帆的桅杆。

 

**【比对&反馈】**

我：他们沿路向老人的小屋走去，黑漆漆的，老人赤脚走着，扛着他小船上的桅杆。

余：他们一路向老人的小屋走去。昏暗中，沿路都有赤脚的渔人肩着自己的船桅走动。

单词都认识，句意理解错了。

## Part 8

 

 

"Do you want coffee?" the boy
asked. 

 

"We'll put the gear in the boat and
then get some." 

 

They had coffee from condensed milk cans
at an early morning place that served fishermen.

 

"How did you sleep old man?"
the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave
his sleep.

 

"Very well, Manolin," the old
man said. "I feel confident today." 

 

"So do I," the boy said.
"Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our
gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."

 

你想喝咖啡吗?男孩问。

 

我们先把船具放到渔船里，再去喝点咖啡。

 

他们在一个为渔夫服务的早点摊，从一些装浓缩牛奶的罐子里喝了些咖啡（余：用炼乳罐头盛咖啡喝）。

 

老人你睡的怎么样?男孩问。虽然打断睡眠，对男孩很难，不过现在他慢慢地醒过来了。

 

很好，Manolin，老人回答。我今天信心十足。

 

我也是，男孩说。现在我得去取你和我的沙丁鱼，还有你的鱼饵。他总是自己拿渔具。他从来不让其他人拿任何东西。

 

"We're different," the old man
said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old." 

 

"I know it," the boy said.
"I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here."

 

He walked off, bare-footed on the coral
rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored. 

 

The old man drank his coffee slowly. It
was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long
time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of
water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.



 

我们两不一样，老人说。你五岁时，我就让你拿东西。

 

我记得，男孩说，我马上回来，你再喝一杯咖啡。我们在这里赊账。

 

说着他走开了，赤着脚走在珊瑚礁岩石上，向着冰窖走去，那里放着鱼饵。（余：他赤脚踩着珊瑚岩，向藏饵的冰屋走去）

 

老人慢慢喝着咖啡。他一整天就吃这些了，他知道他得吃完。吃东西已经困扰他很长一段时间了，他从来不带午饭。他带一瓶水，放在小船的船头。那便是他一整天需要的。

 

The boy was back now with the sardines
and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the
skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid
her into the water. 

"Good luck old man." 

 

"Good luck," the old man said.
He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning
forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of
the harbor in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he
could not see them now the moon was below the hills.



 

 

男孩带着沙丁鱼和报纸包着的两条鱼饵回来了。他们沿着小路走向小船，踩着夹有鹅卵石的沙地，抬起小船，推向海里去。（余：两人踩着夹有卵石的沙地，顺着小径，走到船边，把船抬起，推下海去。）

 

祝你好运（余：一帆风顺），老人

好运，老人回答。他把桨上的绳索系牢，借着桨面划水之势力，向前靠了靠，他开始在黑暗中划出海港。其他一些船也正从别的海滩出海，老人听到了船桨来回滑动拍打海水的声音，即使他此刻看不到他们，现在月亮还在山峦下面。

 

 

**【困惑&难点】**

He fitted the rope lashings of the oars
onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in
the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.这句如何翻译，主要是缺乏渔民捕鱼，划船的背景常识。

 

 

**【比对&反馈】**

我：其他一些船也正从别的海滩出海，老人听到了船桨来回滑动拍打海水的声音，即使他此刻看不到他们，月亮还在山峦下面。

余：别的渔船从别处沙岸出海；虽然现在月落山后，看不见他们，老人却听得见他们木浆起落之声。

中文和英文从句语序结构调整。

 

 

Sometimes someone would speak in a boat.
But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread
apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for
the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was
going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the
phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the
ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep
of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the
swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean.
Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of
squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where
all the wandering fish fed on them.

 

 

有时有人会在船上讲话。然而多数渔船，除了桨划过水面的声音，一片寂静。这些渔船一旦驶离港口，便各自分开，朝着他们觉得能捕到鱼的海域驶去。老人知道自己要去远海，竟自将陆地的气息留在了身后，向清早爽郎的海洋（大洋早晨清新的）气息划去。当他划过渔民们常说的great well水域（余：深井的洋面）时，他看到了海水里漩涡鱼苗（“湾苗”）发出的磷光；此处有一个骤深七百英寻的深渊，洋流撞在海底的峭壁上，产生旋涡，致使各种各样的鱼聚集在这里。这里会有很多的（余：成千成万的）小虾和可做鱼饵的小鱼（余：饵鱼），有时在最深处还有成群的鱿鱼，晚上它们会游到近水面来，被顺流游过的大鱼吃掉。

 

**【困惑&难点】**

长难句的翻译：

He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf
weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen
called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms
where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made
against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean.
