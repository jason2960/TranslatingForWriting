## The Old Man and The Sea   
#### by Ernest Hemingway    
 
Tips:

* 整个小说翻译结束后，再整体读几遍，然后和自己写的《李国栋》对比，修改《李国栋》
* 比对时，把生词都添加到欧陆词典中
* 下次翻译前，要先调整星星提供的英文原文段落划分，调整为余光中的划分方法，原来的会影响段落的理解。

## Part 6 
 
 
"Do you remember when he used to come to the Terrace? I wanted to take him fishing but I was too timid to ask him. Then I asked you to ask him and you were too timid."

“你还记得他来平台的时候吗?我想带他去捕鱼，但我很害羞不敢问他。我又让你去问他，你也害羞的不敢问。”
 
**【比对&反馈】**
余的翻译：“你还记得他以前常来平台吗？我真想带他去钓鱼，可是又不敢请他。后来又叫你去请他，你也不敢。”
简洁，而且顺畅。我自己的读着别扭。
When 引导的remember的宾语从句中when的翻译。
 
 "I know. It was a great mistake. He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives."
 
我知道，那是个大错误。他本来已经和我们一起了。于是我们可以一辈子都在一起捕鱼了。(不会翻译，凭理解，意译)
 
**【比对&反馈】**
余翻译：我记得，那是个打错。他也许真会跟我们去。那真够我们乐一辈子了。
 
**【困惑&难点】**
He might have gone with us. Then we would have that for all of our lives.这两句是属于虚拟语气的翻译吗？
 
"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man said. "They say his father was a fisherman. Maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand."
 "The great Sisler's father was never poor and he, the father, was playing in the Big Leagues when he was my age."（为什么不直接写and his father was……）
 
我很想带伟大的DiMaggio一起捕鱼，老人说。据说他父亲也是一名渔夫。他可能（余：恐怕）和我们一样穷困，窘迫，也能理解我们（余：懂得这一套的）。
伟大的Sisler的父亲一点也不穷，他父亲像我这么大时，正在大联盟里打球呢。
 
"When I was your age I was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to Africa and I have seen lions on the beaches in the evening."

我在你这个年纪时，我正站在一艘船的桅杆前，桅杆上挂着方形船帆，正驶向非洲，在夜晚我在海滩上看到了一群狮子。（夜晚天都黑了，怎么能看到狮子呢，所以应该翻译为黄昏。）
 
**【比对&反馈】**
余的翻译：我像你这么大时，正在去非洲的一条老式帆船上做水手，到黄昏还看见岸上的狮子。
 
 "I know. You told me."
 
我晓得，你讲过了。
 
"Should we talk about Africa or about baseball?"

我们是聊非洲呢，还是棒球?
 
"Baseball I think," the boy said. "Tell me about the great John J. McGraw." He said Jota for J.

我想还是棒球吧，男孩说。给我讲讲伟大的 John J. McGraw。约翰·J·麦格劳。他把Jota叫做J。
 
"He used to come to the Terrace sometimes too in the older days. But he was rough and harsh-spoken and difficult when he was drinking. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. At least he carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the telephone."
他老了以后，偶尔会来平台。但他正喝酒时，他很粗暴，也不好说话，喝起酒来不好应付。他总惦记着赛马，如同总惦记着棒球一样。至少他口袋里总是装着列有赛马名字的单子，而且频频在电话上提到那些马的名字。
 
**【困惑&难点】**
in the older days翻译为早年？
 
"He was a great manager," the boy said. "My father thinks he was the greatest."
"Because he came here the most times," the old man said. "If Durocher had continued to come here each year your father would think him the greatest manager."
"Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?"
"I think they are equal."
And the best fisherman is you."
"No. I know others better."
 
他是名出色的管理者（余：经理人），男孩说。我父亲觉得他是最了不起的。因为他来这里的次数最多，老人说。如果Durocher也年年来这里，你父亲会认为他是最了不起的经理人。
到底谁最了不起呢？Luque还是Mike Gonzalez?
我觉得他们一样了不起。
最棒的渔夫是你。
不，我认识其他更出色的渔夫。
 
"Que va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only you."
"Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.
"There is no such fish if you are still strong as you say,"
"I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution."
"You ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning. I will take the things back to the Terrace."
 
Aue va男孩说，是有很多厉害的渔夫，一些渔夫更出色。但你是唯一的。
谢谢你。你的话让我很开心。我希望不要有很大的鱼过来，否则它会证明我们两都错了。
如果你依然像自己说的那么健壮，就不会有这么大的鱼了。
我可能不像自己想的那么强壮了，老人说。但我懂很多技巧，也有办法（余：决心）。
现在你该睡觉了。这样你明天早上才能有精神。我会把这些东西都送回平台去。
 
"Good night then. I will wake you in the morning."
"You're my alarm clock." the boy said.
"Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?"
"I don't know, the boy said. All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard."
"I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken you in time."
"I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior."
"I know."
"Sleep well old man."
 
那晚安。明早我会来叫你。
你是我的闹钟。男孩说。
年龄（余：老年）是我的闹钟，老人说。为什么老年人醒的这么早?是为了一天过得更长吗?
不知道，男孩说。我只知道年轻人睡得晚，也睡的沉。
我记住了，老人说 我会准时叫醒你的。
我不想为了他，弄醒自己（翻译错误）。似乎我不重要。
我知道。
老人，睡个好觉吧。
 
**【比对&反馈】**
我：我不想为了他，弄醒自己（翻译错误）。似乎我没有价值，不重要。
余：我不喜欢让他来叫醒我，那样显得我不中用。

## Part 7
 
 
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.

男孩走了出去。他们刚吃饭时桌子上并没有灯光，老人脱掉裤子，摸着黑上了床。他把报纸放在裤子上，卷起来做了个枕头。他把自己卷进了毯子，睡在另外一些旧报纸上，它们盖住了床上漏出来的弹簧。
 
**【比对&反馈】**
他把自己卷进了毯子，睡在另外一些旧报纸上，它们盖住了床上漏出来的弹簧。此处的翻译，我认为翻译为这样更合适，更能凸显出老人居住环境的恶劣，贫苦，老人的平穷。
余的翻译：他用毯子裹住身体，睡在铺着旧报纸的弹簧床上。
 
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt your eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morning.

很快他就睡着了，接着他梦见了他小时候去过的非洲，眼前是长长的金色海滩，白得刺眼的沙滩，高耸的海岬以及褐色的山峦。如今他夜夜重回岸边，在梦里，他听到了海浪的咆哮声，看到当地的渔船穿过海浪驶来。他睡着时，闻到了甲板上焦油和麻绳的味道，他闻到了非洲大陆清晨吹来的微风。（余：还有清晨陆上微风送来的非洲气息。）
 
**【比对&反馈】**
他闻到了非洲大陆清晨吹来的微风。（余：还有清晨陆上微风送来的非洲气息。）我没有按照语法规则对应的次序来翻译，另外，句子主干为 他闻到了微风，实属搭配不当。
 
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbors and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.

平时他闻到非洲大陆的微风时，就会醒来，穿好衣服去叫醒男孩。但今晚大陆微风的气息来的很早，他知道在梦里这太早了，便继续做梦，梦见白色的岛屿从海平面上升起，接着他梦到了Canary群岛的各种港口和roadsteads（余：近海的泊站）。
 
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the boy. He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.

他没有梦到暴风雪，也没有女人，没有大事件，没有大鱼，没有战斗，没有力量比拼，没有他的妻子。他只是梦到了现在住的地方，梦到了海滩上的狮子。它们正在黄昏下像小猫一样玩耍，他喜欢（余：爱）这些狮子，就像喜欢男孩一样。他从来没（余：从未）梦到过男孩。他不经意间醒了，从开着的门缝里看了看外面的月亮，打开（余：抖开）裤子并穿上。他来到屋子外面小便完，然后走上小路（余：走上坡），去叫醒男孩。他在清早的寒风中瑟瑟发抖。但他知道，这样发抖，自己就能暖和一点，而且很快他就能（余：要）划船了。
 
**【比对&反馈】**
我的翻译：他没有梦到暴风雪，也没有女人，没有大事件，没有大鱼，没有战斗，没有力量比拼，没有他的妻子。
余的翻译：他不再梦见狂风暴雨，或者女人，或者大场面，或者具鱼，或者拳赛，或者角力，或者亡妻。
No longer 译为不再更合适。因为前面提到过他的妻子死了，所以此处his wife 译为：亡妻。
 
 
The door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly with his bare feet. The boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon. He took hold of one foot gently and held it until the boy woke and turned and looked at him. The old man nodded and the boy took his trousers from the chair by the bed and, sitting on the bed, pulled them on.

男孩住屋的门没锁，他推开门，赤着脚，悄悄走了进去。男孩正在第一个房间一个小床上熟睡，干瘪的月亮照进来，老人透过光线清晰的（余：一眼）看到了（余：他）。他轻轻抓起一只脚，摇了摇（余：不放，自己的翻译属于过度意译），直到男孩醒来，转身看着他。老人点了点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿过他的裤子，坐在床上，穿上了他们。
 
**【比对&反馈】**
How to translate the dying room? 
我的翻译：男孩正在第一个房间一个小床上（状语）熟睡（动词谓语）。
余的翻译：男孩熟睡在第一间房里的小床上。
自己翻译的很多句子都出现类似的毛病，从语法和表达上看都没有问题，英文的表达自然是合适的，然而中文却总是怪怪的，生硬，不够自然。看来翻译的基本功真的是中文，其次才是英文。没有中文的语法，句法，语感积累，翻译出来的英文也不会自然流畅。
 
The old man went out the door and the boy came after him. He was sleepy and the old man put his arm across his shoulders and said, "I am sorry."
"Que'va," the boy said. "It is what a man must do."
They walked down the road to the old man's shack and all along the road, in the dark, barefoot men were moving, carrying the masts of their boats.
When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder.

老人走出屋子，男孩紧跟着他。他还没睡醒，老人抱（余：搂）着男孩的肩膀说：“对不起。”
Qué va（余：哪里话） 男孩说，这正是一个男人应该做的。
他们沿路向老人的小屋走去，黑漆漆的，老人赤脚走着，扛着他小船上的桅杆。一到老人住的小屋，男孩便拿起装鱼绳圈的篮子，鱼钩，鱼叉，老人扛起了卷着船帆的桅杆。
 
**【比对&反馈】**
我：他们沿路向老人的小屋走去，黑漆漆的，老人赤脚走着，扛着他小船上的桅杆。
余：他们一路向老人的小屋走去。昏暗中，沿路都有赤脚的渔人肩着自己的船桅走动。
单词都认识，句意理解错了。

## Part 8
 
 
"Do you want coffee?" the boy asked.
"We'll put the gear in the boat and then get some."
They had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen.
"How did you sleep old man?" the boy asked. He was waking up now although it was still hard for him to leave his sleep.
"Very well, Manolin," the old man said. "I feel confident today."
"So do I," the boy said. "Now I must get your sardines and mine and your fish baits. He brings our gear himself. He never wants anyone to carry anything."

你想喝咖啡吗?男孩问。
我们先把船具放到渔船里，再去喝点咖啡。
他们在一个为渔夫服务的早点摊，从一些装浓缩牛奶的罐子里喝了些咖啡（余：用炼乳罐头盛咖啡喝）。
老人你睡的怎么样?男孩问。虽然打断睡眠，对男孩很难，不过现在他慢慢地醒过来了。
很好，Manolin，老人回答。我今天信心十足。
我也是，男孩说。现在我得去取你和我的沙丁鱼，还有你的鱼饵。他总是自己拿渔具。他从来不让其他人拿任何东西。
 
 
"We're different," the old man said. "I let you carry things when you were five years old."
"I know it," the boy said. "I'll be right back. Have another coffee. We have credit here."
He walked off, bare-footed on the coral rocks, to the ice house where the baits were stored.
The old man drank his coffee slowly. It was all he would have all day and he knew that he should take it. For a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch. He had a bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day.
 
我们两不一样，老人说。你五岁时，我就让你拿东西。
我记得，男孩说，我马上回来，你再喝一杯咖啡。我们在这里赊账。
说着他走开了，赤着脚走在珊瑚礁岩石上，向着冰窖走去，那里放着鱼饵。（余：他赤脚踩着珊瑚岩，向藏饵的冰屋走去）
老人慢慢喝着咖啡。他一整天就吃这些了，他知道他得吃完。吃东西已经困扰他很长一段时间了，他从来不带午饭。他带一瓶水，放在小船的船头。那便是他一整天需要的。
 
The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
"Good luck old man."
"Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills.
 
男孩带着沙丁鱼和报纸包着的两条鱼饵回来了。他们沿着小路走向小船，踩着夹有鹅卵石的沙地，抬起小船，推向海里去。（余：两人踩着夹有卵石的沙地，顺着小径，走到船边，把船抬起，推下海去。）
祝你好运（余：一帆风顺），老人
好运，老人回答。他把桨上的绳索系牢，借着桨面划水之势力，向前靠了靠，他开始在黑暗中划出海港。其他一些船也正从别的海滩出海，老人听到了船桨来回滑动拍打海水的声音，即使他此刻看不到他们，现在月亮还在山峦下面。
 
**【困惑&难点】**
He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row out of the harbor in the dark.这句如何翻译，主要是缺乏渔民捕鱼，划船的背景常识。
 
**【比对&反馈】**
我：其他一些船也正从别的海滩出海，老人听到了船桨来回滑动拍打海水的声音，即使他此刻看不到他们，月亮还在山峦下面。
余：别的渔船从别处沙岸出海；虽然现在月落山后，看不见他们，老人却听得见他们木浆起落之声。
中文和英文从句语序结构调整。
 
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbor and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and baitfish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.

有时有人会在船上讲话。然而多数渔船，除了桨划过水面的声音，一片寂静。这些渔船一旦驶离港口，便各自分开，朝着他们觉得能捕到鱼的海域驶去。老人知道自己要去远海，竟自将陆地的气息留在了身后，向清早爽郎的海洋（大洋早晨清新的）气息划去。当他划过渔民们常说的great well水域（余：深井的洋面）时，他看到了海水里漩涡鱼苗（“湾苗”）发出的磷光；此处有一个骤深七百英寻的深渊，洋流撞在海底的峭壁上，产生旋涡，致使各种各样的鱼聚集在这里。这里会有很多的（余：成千成万的）小虾和可做鱼饵的小鱼（余：饵鱼），有时在最深处还有成群的鱿鱼，晚上它们会游到近水面来，被顺流游过的大鱼吃掉。
 
**【困惑&难点】**
长难句的翻译：
He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the flour of the ocean.

## Part 9
 
 
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the sea.
 
黑暗中老人觉察到早晨即将来临，他划船时，听到了飞鱼飞离水面的抖动声，以及它们僵硬的挥动翅膀在黑暗中向上爬升时发出的嘶嘶声。他很喜欢飞鱼，因为它们是他在海上主要的朋友。他为那些鸟感到难过，尤其是那些弱小纤细的黑燕鸥（余：海燕），它们一直在飞翔觅食，几乎从来一无所获，他想着，“这些鸟的日子比我们更艰难，除了那些偷食（余：掠食）的鸟和那些强壮的鸟。大海如此残忍，老天为何让这些鸟儿和这些海燕一样弱小和纤细。
（余：既然海洋是这么残酷，为什么他们要造出像海燕那么娇小而又精致的鸟儿来呢？）她是善良的，非常美丽的。但她也是残忍的，残忍来的如此突然（变时又那么急骤），这些飞翔着的鸟儿，一面潜水，一面觅食，发出微弱悲悯的声音，和大海比起来，它们显得微不足道。”

He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought. 
  
他总把大海想象为他的 la mar，（情人是指）当人们喜欢她时，他们就这样用西班牙语称呼她。（余：西班牙人爱她的时候，就是这么称呼她的）有时这些爱她的人会说很多她的坏话，但他们总在说，似乎她是位妇女。

一些年轻的渔夫，他们用浮标作为他们鱼线的标记（余：用救生圈做钓索的浮子），他们有摩托艇，是在鲨鱼肝很赚钱时买来的。他们把她(大海)称作 el mar，这充满了男子气息（阳性）。（余：他们说起她时，spoke of her ）他们也把她当做一名对手或某个地方，甚或一个敌人。然而老人总想象她为女子，她能够给予或收回很大的便利，哪怕她做了狂野的或邪恶的事情，那也是因为她情不自禁。在月亮的陪衬下，她显得更像一位女人，他想着。
 
 **【比对&反馈】**
 余：可是老人想起她时，总想她是女性，会施大恩或吝于施恩；如果她有时竟也撒野作恶，那是因为她忍不住。他想，月亮撩她，就像月亮撩女人一样。
 
 The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.翻译为他想，月亮撩她，就像月亮撩女人一样。 太有诗意了。
 
 
 **【困惑&难点】**
 but they are always said as though she were a woman.如何翻译？
 The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.如何翻译？
 
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current. He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

他正平稳地划着船，由于他把控好了速度，划的并不费力；除了洋流偶尔产生的漩涡‘海面平静。他正借力（余：三分之一的力量）洋流划着船，当他看到一些亮光（余：天色开始透明），(余：他看到)他已经到了比他预期这个时候该到更远的地方了。

 **【比对&反馈】**
> as it started to be light 
我：当他看到一些亮光

余：天色开始透明。
对比之下，英文中主语为it，指天气。而我的翻译直接为人做主语，实为翻译错误。
 
I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I'll work out where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.

我以前在一片深水区忙活了一周却一无所获，他想。今天我要去鲣和海产鱼群处（余：今天我要去远些，到松鱼和鱼有鱼集中的地方去），或许那里会有大鱼（和它们一起）。
 
  **【困惑&难点】**
 文中好多地方出现了“school”这个词，而且不同的地方翻译都不同。
 比如：the schools of bonito and albacore 
 
 
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current.One bait was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-gar-land on the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting. 
 
在天真正亮起来之前（余：天色透亮之前），他已经撒好了的鱼饵，它们正飘在洋流上。第一条鱼饵沉下去四十英寻。第二条在七十五英寻处，第三条和第四条分别沉到了蓝色海水中100和125英寻的地方。每条鱼饵的头部挂在鱼钩的钩颈处，鱼钩穿过了整条鱼，鱼饵被紧紧的系住，缝住；整个鱼钩，鱼线和钩尖，都用沙丁鱼盖住了。每条沙丁鱼都用鱼钩穿过双眼，一般的鱼钩都被沙丁鱼裹住了。每条闻不到鱼饵味道和好味道的鱼，也不会感觉到鱼钩任何一部分的存在。

 我：每条鱼饵的头部挂在鱼钩的钩颈处，鱼钩穿过了整条鱼，鱼饵被紧紧的系住，缝住；整个鱼钩，鱼线和钩尖，都用沙丁鱼盖住了。每条沙丁鱼都用鱼钩穿过双眼，一般的鱼钩都被沙丁鱼裹住了。每条闻不到鱼饵味道和好味道的鱼，也不会感觉到鱼钩任何一部分的存在。
 余：每个引饵都倒垂水中，钩柄藏在饵鱼腹内……钓钩上，大鱼所能接触到的部分莫不香甜可口。
 
 对比后发现，自己并没有完全理解the meaning between the lines,即没有在脑海中准确建立起老人把鱼饵布置在鱼钩上的画面，只是有个模糊的印象，因此只做到了字词层面的翻译。尤其最后一句，读英文能get到它要表达的意思，中文却死活翻译不出来。

## Part 10
 
 
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.
 
 
男孩给了他两条新鲜的金枪鱼和花科水产鱼（余：小鱼有鱼），他们像铅垂一样挂在两条入水最深的鱼线上，另外，他还有一条大的蓝鱼（余：蓝色的大鲹鱼）和一条黄色甲壳鱼（余：黄梭鱼），之前用过了，但他们还能用（完好可用），还是会有敏捷的沙丁鱼能闻到它们的气味，被它们吸引。（翻译错误，余：而且有那些上好的沙丁鱼来增加香味和诱惑）每条鱼线（余：钓索），圆又厚，宛如一支粗铅笔，系在一根绿色木棍上，这样一旦鱼饵被拉动，木棍会碰到水面，每条线都有两个四十英寻长的线圈，这样如果需要，可以很快的接上其它匀出来的线圈（余：备索），而且咬了钩的鱼可以拖着线（余：钓索）游三百英寻。

Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise. 
 
 此刻老人看着小船一侧的三根木棍浸入水面，轻轻划着小船使鱼线直直地保持在适当的深度。天大亮了，此刻太阳也升起来了。（余：一面缓缓地划动，使钩锁拖直，并且保持各自应有的深度。天色已经透亮，眼看太阳就要升上。）
 
 
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred. 
 
太阳从海平面露出尖尖的一头，老人看到其它的渔船了，这些渔船低于海面，远离海岸，穿过洋流分散开来。（余：旭日从海底淡淡地升起，老人看到了别的渔船紧贴着水面，远靠海岸，而且散布在湾流四处。）这时太阳闪闪发亮，刺眼的光照在海面上，太阳完全升了起来（余：不久阳光更亮，光芒照在水面，等到全轮升尽）；水平的海面把阳光反射进老人的眼睛，深深的刺痛了老人的眼睛（余：十分刺眼），他划着船不看海面。他向水面看下去，看着钓索直直地伸向了黑漆漆的水下。这些钓索更加笔直了，这点他比其它任何人做的都好，这样做的好处就是，能确保水面下黑暗处不同的高度，都会有鱼饵确切的分布在他期望的位置，等待着游过这些地方的任何一条鱼。其它渔人会让鱼线随着洋流漂浮着，有时，它们在六十英寻的地方，而他们还以为它们在一百英寻的地方。

 基本的句意翻译出来了，只是语言十分啰嗦，不够简练，是不符合海明威的风格的。与余的翻译比对，更凸显自己这点的不足。或许无论写作，还是翻译，一遍，甚至两遍是远远不够的。海明威的原著不也是修改了几十遍吗？

low on the water and well in toward the shore，spread out across the current.如何翻译？
 
 
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. 

但（余：可是），他想着，我就是要让鱼饵保持在精确的位置。难道我再也不会有好运了。但谁知道呢？或许就今天。每天都是崭新的。交到好运固然好。但我宁愿把钓索布置在精确的位置。这样好运来临时，我就准备好了。

The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore. 

又过了两个小时，太阳升的更高了（余：这时，太阳已经升上来两个小时）。向东望去，阳光也不那么刺眼。目前视野所及，只能看到三条船，它们看着距海面更低，距离海岸也更远了。


All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
 
他想，早上的阳光刺眼了一辈子。可是我的眼力依然健好。到了傍晚，我正视落日，眼睛也不会发黑。落日的威力较大。可是旭日真伤眼睛。（from余）

  **【比对&反馈】**
我：我早年的生活中，太阳光一直在伤害我的眼睛。然而眼睛还是很好。晚上我可以直直地看到海面下，而不是一团漆黑。晚上我会看的更清楚。但早上看东西会有点疼。**整个段落的理解，翻译都错误。why?**
余：他想，早上的阳光刺眼了一辈子。可是我的眼力依然健好。到了傍晚，我正视落日，眼睛也不会发黑。落日的威力较大。可是旭日真伤眼睛。 
 
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then circled again. 

正在那个时候，他看到一只军舰鸟，拖着长长的黑色尾翼(余：展开黑色的常翼)，在他面前的天空中盘旋。它急速下降，倾斜在后掠翼一侧，再次盘旋起来。

"He's got something," the old man said aloud. "He's not just looking." 

他一定抓到什么东西了。老人大声叫着。他不只看看的。

He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird.
 
他缓慢又平静的划向那只鸟盘旋的地方。他不着急（从容不迫），保持着他所有的鱼线直直的。但他还是到了洋流稍微湍急的地方，这样他依然可以正确的捕鱼，虽然比他本来要捕鱼的地方会快点。如果他不试着利用那只鸟。

余：
没有理解这句话的确切含义，所以只把单词的意思翻译出来了。


The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.

这只鸟向更高的天空飞去，再次盘旋起来，只是尾翼不动了。他猛地一下扎进了海面，老人看到飞鱼跳出了水面，拼命在海面上游着。

"Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin." 

海豚（余：鲯鳅），老人大声叫着，一只大海豚。

He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water. 

他把浆放回船上，从船头下方拿出一根小型的鱼线（余：细索）。它由一根金属线和一个中号的钩子做成，他把其中一条沙丁鱼放上当鱼饵。然后他带着它来到船的一侧，迅速绕了个圈，直直地扔进了船尾的海水里。接着他又为另一根鱼线装上了鱼饵，缠绕在线圈上，并把它留在了船头阴影下。他返回去继续划船，并看着长尾黑鸟，此刻，它正贴着水面飞行。

文本对比时，体会限定性形容词性从句和非限定性形容词从句的翻译。
watching the long-winged black bird who was working,
 
As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish. The dolphins were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird has no chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
 
当他正看到这只鸟再次潜水，倾斜着翅膀钻进水面，然后狂乱徒劳地（吃力地）摆动着翅膀，紧跟着飞鱼。老人能够看到水面有轻微的凸起，这是那只大鲯鳅正在追踪逃跑的鱼，升上水面时造成的。鲯鳅正在从水下切断鱼的路线，然后当鱼的速度变慢，游不动时，趁机加速抓住它。好大一群鲯鳅，他想着，他们四处都是，飞鱼几乎没有生还的机会。那些鸟也没有。这些飞鱼对老人而言太大，而且他们游的也太快了。

**【比对&反馈】**
对比完上述这段话，我更加迷惑了，小说中的这些鲯鳅，飞鱼，军舰鸟，到底谁吃谁？背景知识真的很重要。
 
He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird. That school has gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them. My big fish must be somewhere.
 
他看着这些飞鱼一次又一次迸出水面，还有那些鸟儿徒劳的游动（飞逐）。那群鲯鳅已经游远了，他想。他们游的太快，太远了。但说不定我能逮到一条游散的鲯鳅呢，亦或我的大鱼就在它们中间。我的大鱼肯定在某个地方。
 
The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man of war floating close beside the boat. It turned on its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
 
内陆上方的云像层层山峦涌起，海岸变为一条长长的绿线（余：一痕绿色的长线），后面坐落着一座座灰蓝色的山峰。海水现在是深蓝色的，深的近乎发紫。当他看向海水里，他看到深蓝色的水中有很多红色微小的浮游生物，以及此刻太阳光折射产生的奇异的光线。他检查了他的鱼线看它们是否笔直伸到水面下，直到看不到的水面下，他看到这么多浮游生物很开心，这意味着有鱼。这时太阳也升的更高，阳光照进水里产生的奇异光速，这些都意味着好天气（余：气候晴好），还有内陆上方云朵的形状。但此刻几乎看不到鸟儿了，水面上除了一些黄色的斑块，太阳晒白了的海草种子以及一个葡萄牙军人坐在一个紫色的，正式的，变色的胶状袋子上漂浮在一艘船旁边，除此之外，也什么都看不到了。它转了个身，然后又转回来。它像个泡沫一般心甘情愿的飘着，在水面上拖了一条长长的深紫色的细细的涟漪。

这段当时翻译的时候就很痛苦，刚才和余的翻译比对完，更验证了自己确实没读懂这段话。碰到这样的句子，翻译的时候正是折磨和煎熬。
