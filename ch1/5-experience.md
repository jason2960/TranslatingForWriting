# Ch 1-Part 1-5 

## The Old Man and The Sea   
#### by Ernest Hemingway    

## 翻译难点：

- old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky

尤其 salao 不知道如何译。

- The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.

- They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. 


- I brought the fish in too green 

too green ? 

cast net？

- get him to come out after dolphin

- The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobrey.

- There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too. 

然而没有渔网了，男孩想起来，他们已经卖掉它了。但他们每天都会过一遍这个情节。其实男孩也知道，根本没有黄米和鱼。

【此处这段话是什么意思，作者为什么这么写，用意是什么?】


- The great DiMaggio is himself again.

## 翻译感想

第一周的第一部分翻译下来，远比想像中的难，比想象中的无聊，比想象中的累。翻译和写作不同，写作的时候很容易产生心流，而翻译则只能老老实实的跟着作者的文本翻译，而且还总担心翻译错了，曲解了作者的原意，尽管这样的错误在所难免。

以前写作的时候，有心流的缘故吧，感觉时间过的特别快，还没写多少，就三五个小时过去了。而翻译的时候则总是会不自主的看手机，感觉时间过的特别慢。

这部小说中很多带有明显文化特征的表达，不好翻译。总之，我越来越觉得，翻译是件出力不讨好的事情。也好奇一个问题，有能力翻译某本书的人，自身的英文阅读能力肯定不差，也自然能读懂，而且还能很快的读完，那他还为什么要翻译呢?有翻译的时间和精力，他可以读更多的书了，想必，万维钢，王砾，阳志平都是知道翻译的苦和费时的。

# Ch 1-Part 1-5  译文对比反馈 | 20180418

我把自己的译文与余光中的对照后，发现自己译文最大的几个问题是：

- 译文大都生硬，甚至都不如谷歌翻译的好。且大都是以句子，段落的形式简单的翻译，没有联系上下文进行校对，很多地方翻译的莫名其妙。

比如，"He hasn't much faith."这句。我翻译为：他没什么信仰。而余译为：他不大有信心。联系上下文的语境，就明白了，自己的翻译无异于机器人的成果。而这样的例子，比比皆是。


- 与余的译本对比，方知道自己的啰嗦，无知。好几处英文词语译错，不说，自己的译文毫无文采。


- 任意篡改，原文段落中分段的标点符号。比如：

> They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. The old man's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.
 
译文：这是一双有点怪的肩膀，年老却有力，脖子依然强壮，皱纹不多。老人熟睡时，头向前低垂着。他的衬衫已经补过多次，起来像船帆，补丁在日光的照晒下，褪色到留下不同的阴影了。老人的头，大脑很老了，双眼紧闭，脸上毫无生气。晚风吹过，报纸盖在他的两条膝盖上。手臂重重的压着它们，他赤着双脚。

我翻译的标点符号与英文完全不一致，而且还有很多译文有这样的毛病。


- 遇到长难句时，或不易翻译的句子时，总是按照自己的主观臆断，肆意翻译，全然不顾英文原文的句法结构，以及隐含的意义和文化背景。比如下面一段的翻译：

> The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobrey.

老人把桅杆和裹着的船帆靠在墙上，男孩把木箱子和其他渔具放在旁边。桅杆几乎和这个小屋的房间一样长。这个小屋是由粗糙的棕榈叶子搭建的，人们把这种叶子称作guano。屋里有一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，一片用木炭做过饭后留下的脏地方。纤细厚实的的guano叶子平铺在棕色的墙上。墙上有一幅画。另以及纯洁的Cobrey.

其它反馈:

- 我自己的翻译操作顺序为：我们翻译一段话，或一句话时，首先弄清楚句子的语法结构。识别出句子的主干，哪部分是主句，哪些是从句，从句是名词从句，形容词从句，还是副词从句，主句与从句之间的关系（这点在副词从句中尤为重要），并列句中两个句子的关系，连接词是否省略（同样是副词从句容易出问题）。当连接词省略，而用介词短语，现在分词，过去分词，不定式作修饰成分时，要搞清楚这些修饰部分与主句，之间是并列，转折，还是某种从属关系。先把这些理顺了，再翻译。再结合上下文的语境修订，比如人称代词的指代是否一致，整段话是否合乎逻辑。然后再从汉语的表达习惯，审视文字，结合语境以及表达的场合，最后加上自己的文字风格修改。

- 文章的分段翻译，以余光中的英文版本为主，不一定按照GitHub上的分段。

- 大家一起语音讨论当周的翻译文本时，一定要有一个人记录讨论的内容与大家的收获反馈。

- 提交翻译的文本时，建议按照下面个格式，便于后期直接的对比，思考，反馈，讨论。
译文中要包含英文，一段英文后直接写翻译的中文。若在翻译时有疑问或难点，可直接将**疑惑和难点**写在中文的后面，这样翻译完，和其它版本比对时，直接把自己的**反馈与收获**再写在**疑惑和难点**的后面，即时形成闭环。具体格式，可参考：

```

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. 

老人面容枯瘦，脖子后面映着几道深深的皱纹。从热带海洋水面反射上来的太阳光，照在他脸上，脸上布满棕色的老年斑，这些老年斑从侧脸一直延伸至他的侧脸。他的双手充满一道道皱起的伤疤，这些伤疤是他捕大鱼时绳子勒的。不过它们都是些旧伤疤，和无鱼的沙漠的侵蚀一样古老。


**【困惑&难点】**
 
- The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.

- They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

两句不知如何翻译。

**【讨论&比对&反馈】**

- They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.这句，张爱玲的翻译最有文采，比喻翻译的最形象。

比对后，发现自己之所以不会翻译上述第一句，首先读完后被它里面连续的修饰词吓到了，也没有先去找出句子的主干，再依次调整里面修饰成分的顺序，进而有序的翻译。
