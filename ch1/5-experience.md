# Ch 1-Part 1-5 

## The Old Man and The Sea   
#### by Ernest Hemingway    

## 翻译难点：

- old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky

尤其 salao 不知道如何译。

- The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.

- They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. 


- I brought the fish in too green 

too green ? 

cast net？

- get him to come out after dolphin

- The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobrey.

- There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too. 

然而没有渔网了，男孩想起来，他们已经卖掉它了。但他们每天都会过一遍这个情节。其实男孩也知道，根本没有黄米和鱼。

【此处这段话是什么意思，作者为什么这么写，用意是什么?】


- The great DiMaggio is himself again.

## 翻译感想

第一周的第一部分翻译下来，远比想像中的难，比想象中的无聊，比想象中的累。翻译和写作不同，写作的时候很容易产生心流，而翻译则只能老老实实的跟着作者的文本翻译，而且还总担心翻译错了，曲解了作者的原意，尽管这样的错误在所难免。

以前写作的时候，有心流的缘故吧，感觉时间过的特别快，还没写多少，就三五个小时过去了。而翻译的时候则总是会不自主的看手机，感觉时间过的特别慢。

这部小说中很多带有明显文化特征的表达，不好翻译。总之，我越来越觉得，翻译是件出力不讨好的事情。也好奇一个问题，有能力翻译某本书的人，自身的英文阅读能力肯定不差，也自然能读懂，而且还能很快的读完，那他还为什么要翻译呢?有翻译的时间和精力，他可以读更多的书了，想必，万维钢，王砾，阳志平都是知道翻译的苦和费时的。
