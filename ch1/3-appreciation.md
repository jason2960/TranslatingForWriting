# Ch 1-Part 1-5 

## The Old Man and The Sea   
#### by Ernest Hemingway    


## Part 1

He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. 

他是位老人，乘坐一条小木船，独自在海湾捕鱼。到现在(到今天)他已经离家84天了，却没捕到一条鱼。前面四十天，有个小男孩和他在一起，然而接下来四十天，他们没有捕到一条鱼，小男孩的父母告诉他，老人现在确切地，最终地*salao*。也就是说，他现在的运气不能更坏了。于是男孩遵照父母的指令（要求），去了另一条船，这条船在出海的头一周就捕鱼到了三条大鱼。

**【困惑&难点】**

- old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky *salao* 不知道如何译。

**【比对&反馈】**

和大家讨论后，觉得余翻译的**晦气星**最好，但这需要很深的文学功底和词汇的积累。


It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. 

看到老人每天空着船回来，小男孩很难过。他总是走到海滩去，帮他拿盘绕的一圈一圈的捕鱼线，鱼叉，矛式鱼叉，卷在桅杆上的船帆。船帆是用面粉袋缝补做的，卷在一起，像一面永远胜利的旗帜。

flag of permanent defeat 词义翻译错误


The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert. 

老人面容枯瘦，脖子后面映着几道深深的皱纹。从热带海洋水面反射上来的太阳光，照在他脸上，脸上布满棕色的老年斑，这些老年斑从侧脸一直延伸至他的侧脸。他的双手充满一道道皱起的伤疤，这些伤疤是他捕大鱼时绳子勒的。不过它们都是些旧伤疤，和无鱼的沙漠的侵蚀一样古老。


**【困惑&难点】**
 
- The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks.

- They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

两句不知如何翻译。

**【讨论&比对&反馈】**

- They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.这句，张爱玲的翻译最有文采，比喻翻译的最形象。

比对后，发现自己之所以不会翻译上述第一句，首先读完后被它里面连续的修饰词吓到了，也没有先去找出句子的主干，再依次调整里面修饰成分的顺序，进而有序的翻译。



Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. 

老人拥有的一切都是老旧的，除了他的眼睛，它们如大海般的深蓝，充满喜悦，透着坚定。

"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. "I could go with you again. 

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them." 

"圣地亚哥"男孩对他说着，他们从小船停靠处走上海滩。"我们又可以一起捕鱼了，我们已经赚些钱了" 

老人以前教过男孩捕鱼，男孩喜欢他。

"不行"老人说，"你现在的船很走运，你就在那条船上吧"

"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks." 


"I remember," the old man said. "I know you did not leave me because you doubted." 

"It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him." 

"I know," the old man said. "It is quite normal."

"He hasn't much faith."

"No," the old man said. "But we have. Haven't we?"

"Yes," the boy said. "Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home."

"Why not?" the old man said, "Between fishermen." 

但你记得你出海87天竟没捕到一条鱼，我们却在之后三个星期的每一天都捕到了大鱼的情形吗？

**【讨论&比对&反馈】** 余将此句译为三个短句，读起来更有节奏，而且有层层递进的画面感。

我记得，老人说到，我知道你不愿意离开我，是因为你不相信我捕不到鱼。

是爸爸非让我离开你的，我只是个孩子，我必须听他的。

我明白，老人说，这很正常。

他没什么信仰。

是的，老人说到， 但我们有，我们有吗?

有，男孩说到，我可以在排屋里给你买瓶啤酒，然后我们再把这些东西拿回家。

为什么不呢（好啊）老人说到，两个渔夫的小酌。

**【讨论&比对&反馈】**

这几句对话，译的过于生硬，尤其 normal，faith，must, 没有结合上下文以及对话的语境翻译。尤其这两个词，"Between fishermen." 而余的翻译“好呀，打鱼的还用客气吗！”近乎传神。

They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were sad.

他们（老人与男孩）在排屋里坐下时，很多渔夫在取笑老人，他并不生气。其他一些老渔夫看着他，流露出一丝的悲伤。

But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.

但他们并没有表现出来。他们礼貌地谈论着洋流，谈论着他们撒出的捕鱼线的深度，持续的好天气，以及他们在捕鱼时看到的一些东西。

## Part2 

The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.

当天捕到鱼的渔夫都回来了，他们已经把捕到的枪鱼宰杀完，把它们从头到尾放到鱼屋fish house里两块并排的厚木板上，两名渔夫各自站在木板的两端，他们正等着冰车，好把这些宰杀好的鱼运到哈瓦那的鱼市上去。捕到鲨鱼的渔夫们，已经把鲨鱼运至海湾另一侧的鲨鱼屠宰场。在那里，屠夫把鲨鱼用滑轮吊起来，掏掉肝脏，剪掉鱼鳍，剥掉鱼皮，鱼身切成细条腌起来。

与余的版本对比后，才发现自己
> The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana.

这句译的不准确，甚至翻译错误，还是对英文中过去分词，现在分词，介词短语做修饰语时表达的意思拿捏不准，往往按照自己的理解翻译，而非基于语法逻辑翻译。

When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbor from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odor because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace. 

东风吹过，带着一股海腥味，从鲨鱼屠宰场穿过港口吹了过来；今天腥味很淡，风吹回北方，带走了腥味，排屋里充满愉悦的温暖的气息。

"Santiago," the boy said.

"Yes," the old man said. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago. 

"Can I go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow?" 

"No. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net."

"I would like to go. If I cannot fish with you, I would like to serve in some way."

"圣地亚哥"男孩叫道。

嗯，老人答道。他正端着玻璃杯，想着多年前的往事。

我能去外面去为你准备明天用的沙丁鱼吗？

不用了，去玩棒球吧。我还能划船，Rogelio可以撒网。

我想去，即使我不能和你一起捕鱼，我想以这种方式帮你。

"You bought me a beer," the old man said. "You are already a man."

"How old was I when you first took me in a boat?"

"Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Can you remember?" 

"你已经给我买一瓶啤酒了"。老人继续说道，"你已经是一个男子汉了"。

你第一次带上我上船时，我多大?

五岁，当我把鱼也放进船舱时，它几乎把船咬成碎片了，你也差点被鱼吃掉。你还记得吗?


**【比对&反馈】**

这句的翻译
> Five and you nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces.

有失准确。尤其是对tore这次词的理解。

"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."


我能记得……

"Can you really remember that or did I just tell it to you?" "I remember everything from when we first went together." The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes. "If you were my boy I'd take you out and gamble," he said. "But you are your father's and your mother's and you are in a lucky boat." 

"你果真记得那件事，还是我刚告诉了你？"
 
"自从我们第一次一起捕鱼起，我记得所有的事情。"
（余的翻译为**从我们第一回一同出海起，我什么都记得**，只此一句，余的简洁让我拜服。）
 
老人用他炽热的，自信的，充满爱意的双眼看着男孩。
 
"如果你是我儿子，我会带你出海，赌一把"， 他说道，"但你是你父亲和你母亲的儿子，(况且)你现在在一条幸运的船上"。

"May I get the sardines? I know where I can get four baits too." "I have mine left from today. I put them in salt in the box." "Let me get four fresh ones."

"我可以去准备沙丁鱼了吗?我知道哪里也可以弄到四条鱼饵。"
 
"我有昨天剩下的。我把它们放到盒子里腌起来了。"
 
"让我再去拿四条新鲜的吧。“

"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never gone. But now they were freshening as when the breeze rises. "Two," the boy said. "Two," the old man agreed. "You didn't steal them?" "I would," the boy said. "But I bought these." 

"一条，"老人说道。他的希望和他的自信永远不会消失了。而且现在它们就像海风吹过时那样新鲜。
 
“两条”，男孩说道
 
“两条”，老人同意了。“你不会是去偷吧？”

“以前会”，男孩说到，“但这次我会去买。”

"Thank you," the old man said. He was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility. But he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true pride. 

"Tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current," he said. 

"Where are you going?" the boy asked.
 
谢谢你，老人说道。他太单纯，以至于不知道自己什么时候变得谦卑起来。但他知道他确实谦卑了。他也知道这并不丢人，也没有丢掉真正的自尊。
 
从目前的洋流看，明天会是个好天气。他说道

你去哪里捕鱼？男孩问道

----

## Part 3 

"Far out to come in when the wind shifts. I want to be out before it is light." 

我想顺着海风，去远处捕鱼，再回来（**翻译错误**）。并在天亮前出发。


"I'll try to get him to work far out," the boy said. "Then if you hook something truly big we can come to your aid." 

我让他(男孩父亲)也到远处捕鱼，男孩说道，这样要是你捕鱼到大鱼了，我们能赶来帮你。

"He does not like to work too far out." 

"No," the boy said. "But I will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get him to come out after dolphin." 

"Are his eyes that bad?" 

"He is almost blind." 

"It is strange," the old man said. "He never went turtle-ing. That is what kills the eyes."

他不喜欢到远的海域捕鱼。

不，男孩说到，我能看到一些他看不到的东西，比如，一只飞翔的鸟，并让他跟在海豚后面。

他的眼睛有那么糟糕吗?

他几乎瞎了。

这就奇怪了，老人说道，他从来不捕甲鱼，而捕甲鱼会伤眼睛。

"But you went turtle-ing for years off the Mosquito Coast and your eyes are good." 

"I am a strange old man." 

"But are you strong enough now for a truly big fish?"

"I think so. And there are many tricks."

"Let us take the stuff home," the boy said. "So I can get the cast net and go after the sardines."

They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff （后置介词短语做形容词）and the harpoon with its shaft.

但是你在mosquito海岸线，捕甲鱼这么多年了，你的眼睛还是好的。

我是个怪异的老人。

那你现在还足够强壮捕到一条真正的大鱼吗?

我想是的。并且我还有很多窍门。

我们把这些东西拿回家吧，男孩说道，这样我就拿到渔网去捕沙丁鱼了。

他们从船上拿起渔具。老人肩上抗起桅杆（余用的词是**掮**），男孩拿着木箱子和硬质棕色盘起来的线圈和鱼叉。

The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were needless temptationsm to leave in a boat. They walked up the road together to the old man's shack and went in through its open door.

放鱼饵的箱子会放在渔船船尾木棍的下方，这跟木棍用来把捕到的大鱼和小船固定在一起。没人会从老人这里偷东西，但最好把这些船帆和鱼线带回家，因为露水对他们并不好，虽然他确信本地人都不会从他这里偷东西，老人觉得没必要把把鱼叉和矛式鱼叉留在船上。他们一起沿路走向老人的小屋，走进了掩着的门。

The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another of the Virgin of Cobrey.

老人把桅杆和裹着的船帆靠在墙上，男孩把木箱子和其他渔具放在旁边。桅杆几乎和这个小屋的房间一样长。这个小屋是由粗糙的棕榈叶子搭建的，人们把这种叶子称作guano。屋里有一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，一片用木炭做过饭后留下的脏地方。纤细厚实的的guano叶子平铺在棕色的墙上。墙上有一幅画。另以及纯洁的Cobrey.

These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt. 

"What do you have to eat?" the boy asked. 

"A pot of yellow rice with fish. Do you want some?" 

"No. I will eat at home. Do you want me to make the fire?" 

"No. I will make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold."

"May I take the cast net?"

"Of course."

这些是老人生活的残骸。曾经墙上挂着一张他妻子的彩色照片，但他把它拿下来了，因为照片让他显得很孤单以致看不到它了。它就在墙角落的架子上，他干净的衬衫下面。

你有什么吃的吗? 男孩问道，

一罐黄米和鱼，你要吃些吗?

不了，我回家吃。你想让我生火吗?

不用了，我一会生。或者我可能直接吃冷饭了。

我可以把渔网拿走了吗?

当然


---

## Part 4 

There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went through this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too. 

然而没有渔网了，男孩想起来，他们已经把它卖掉了。但他们每天都会过一遍这个情节。其实男孩也知道，根本没有黄米和鱼。

"Eighty-five is a lucky number," the old man said. "How would you like to see me bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?" 

85是个幸运的数字，老人说道，你想看我捕一条带着那个数字的，超过1000磅的大鱼吗?

"I'll get the cast net and go for sardines. Will you sit in the sun in the doorway?" "Yes. I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball."

我带着渔网，去捞沙丁鱼了。你会坐在门口的太阳下吗?

会，我这里有昨天的报纸，我会读棒球的专栏，版面，报道。

The boy did not know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from under the bed. 

男孩不确定是否昨天的报纸也是一部虚构的小说。但老人从床底下拿出了报纸。

"Perico gave it to me at the bodega," he explained, 

"I'll be back when I have the sardines. I'll keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning. When I come back you can tell me about the baseball." 

Perico在酒店给了我这个，他解释说，我捕到沙丁鱼，就回来。我会把你的和我的一起放在冰窖里，这样我们明天早上可以吃。我回来时，你可以告诉我关于棒球的消息。

"The Yankees cannot lose."

"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland."

"Have faith in the Yankees my son. Think of the great DiMaggio." 

"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland."

洋基队不会输。但我担心克里兰夫的印第安人。要对洋基队有信心，我的孩子。想想伟大的Dimaggio. DETROIT老虎和克里兰夫的印第安人我都担心。

"Be careful or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sox of Chicago."

"You study it and tell me when I come back."

"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day." 

"We can do that," the boy said. "But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?" 

"It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?"

"I can order one." 

"One sheet. That's two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?"

"That's easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half."

当心，否则你将会害怕reds of cincinnati 和white sox of chicago。

你研究一下它们，等我回来后，可以告诉我。

你觉得我们应该买一张末尾是数字85的彩票吗?明天就是滴85天了。

可以，男孩说道，但你最好的记录87怎么办呢?

这样的事情不会再发生了，你觉得你能买到一张有数字85的彩票吗?

我可以预定一张

一张，那是2.5美元。我们能找谁借到这笔钱呢?

这个容易，我总会借到2.5美元的。

我想大概我也可以吧。但我试着不借。首先，你借钱，然后你就得求人。

你要注意保暖，老人。男孩说到。记着现在是九月份了。

大鱼要来了的月份。老人说道。

任何人在五月都是个好渔夫。任何人在五月都能捕到鱼。

我现在去准备沙丁鱼了。男孩说。


"I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg."

"Keep warm old man," the boy said. "Remember we are in September."

"The month when the great fish come," the old man said. "Anyone can be a fisherman in May." 

"I go now for the sardines," the boy said. 

When the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down. The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man's shoulders.

男孩回来时，老人在躺椅上睡着了。太阳下山了。男孩从床上拿下那条老旧的军用毯子，越过躺椅的后背，盖在老人的肩膀上。

They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun. The old man's head was very old though and with his eyes closed there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.
 
这是一双有点怪的肩膀，年老却有力，脖子依然强壮，皱纹不多。老人熟睡时，头向前低垂着。他的衬衫已经补过多次，起来像船帆，补丁在日光的照晒下，褪色到留下不同的阴影了。老人的头，大脑很老了，双眼紧闭，脸上毫无生气。晚风吹过，报纸盖在他的两条膝盖上。手臂重重的压着它们，他赤着双脚。

## Part 5

The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep. 

"Wake up old man," the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man's knees. 

The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled. 

"What have you got?" he asked. 

"Supper," said the boy. "We're going to have supper." 

"I'm not very hungry."

"Come on and eat. You can't fish and not eat.

"I have," the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket.

男孩离开了小屋，当他再次回来时，老人依然在熟睡。

醒醒，老人 男孩叫道，把手放到老人一条腿的膝盖上，并叫道。（**【比对&反馈】** 翻译时，我们还要靠想象力，还原英文呈现的场景，这样翻译出的文字，才顺畅，才会有画面感。）

老人睁开双眼，过了一会，好像他正从很远很远的地方回来，醒来。接着他笑了。

你拿到什么了，他问道

晚饭， 男孩说，我们要吃晚饭了。

我现在不是很饿。

来，吃吧。不吃饭，你无法捕鱼的。

我能捕，老人说着，起来，拿起报纸，折好。接着他把毯子也折好。

"Keep the blanket around you," the boy said. "You'll not fish without eating while I'm alive."

"Then live a long time and take care of yourself," the old man said, "What are we eating?"

"Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew."

The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set. 

"Who gave this to you?" 

"Martin. The owner."

"I must thank him."

毯子盖着吧，男孩说，你如果不吃饭，就捕不了鱼，即使我在现场。?

活很长的时间，然后照顾好你自己，老人说，我们吃什么?

黄豆和米饭，炸香蕉还有炖汤。男孩已经从排屋带回来了，装在一个两层的金属容器里。口袋里装着两付刀叉和勺子，他们用纸质餐巾纸各自包着。

谁给你这些的?

马丁，店主

我得谢谢他

"I thanked him already," the boy said. "You don't need to thank him."

"I'll give him the belly meat of a big fish," the old man said. "Has he done this for us more than once?"

"I think so." 

"I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us."

"He sent two beers."

"I like the beer in cans best." 

"I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles." 

"That's very kind of you," the old man said. "Should we eat?"

我已经谢过他了。男孩说道。你没必要再谢他了。

我会把大鱼腹部的鱼肉送给他。老人说道。他以前也送过我们这些东西吗?

我想是的，我想送过。

那我必须送给他一些比鱼腹肉更好的东西。他太为我们着想了。

他送了两瓶啤酒。

我最喜欢罐装啤酒了。

我知道，但这是瓶装的，Hatuey啤酒，我还得把瓶子送回去。

你真是太好了。老人说道。我们可以吃了吗?

"I've been asking you to," the boy told him gently. "I have not wished to open the container until you were ready." 

"I'm ready now," the old man said. "I only needed time to wash."

Where did you wash? The boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket. 

"Your stew is excellent," the old man said.

我一直在问你呀，男孩温柔的对他说道。我希望你准备好吃饭后，我再打开饭盒。

我现在准备好了。老人说道。我只想有点时间洗脸。

你到哪里洗呢?男孩考虑着，想着。村子的供水点离这里有两条街远。我得给他去打水。男孩想着。并给他准备一块香皂，一条好的毛巾。我怎么这么粗心大意呢?我还得给他准备另一件衬衫，一个夹套冬天穿，以及某种鞋子和另一种毯子。

这个炖汤很好喝，老人说道。

"Tell me about the baseball," the boy asked him. 

"In the American League it is the Yankees as I said," the old man said happily.

"They lost today," the boy told him.

"That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again." 

"They have other men on the team."

"Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park." 

"There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen."

给我讲讲棒球吧，男孩向老人问道。

美国的联盟，正如我说过的，也就洋基队，老人欢快的说着，

他们今天输了，男孩告诉他。

那说明不了什么。

The great DiMaggio is himself again.

他们队里还有其它人。

自然，但他与众不同。在其它联盟，在布鲁克林和费城，我必须选布鲁克林。我想到了Dick Sisler和那些great drives in the old park

再也没人能像他们一样了。他击出了我见过最长的球。
